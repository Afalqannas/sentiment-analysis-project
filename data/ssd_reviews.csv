9,good ssd for sata,i bought this for to replace a wd 1 5tb black hdd used to hold games the reason behind moving my game storage from a hdd to an ssd was to decrease game load times the 2nd reason was 1tb ssd s are finally hitting a good price point this review is late in coming i have owned this ssd for 2 years now i ran crysaldiskmark to perform the testing do to the speed of the drive i was not able to test its potential real data transfer speed as a note to the speed tests i am not sure why the newer 850 is slower than my older one samsung 850 evo 1tb read 403 mb s write 411 mb s 2017 model firmware emt03b6q for comparisonsamsung 860 evo 256gb read 542 mb s write 509 mb s new drive in another computer samsung 850 pro 512gb read 553 mb s write 502 mb s 2014 model firmware exm04b6q samsung 850 evo 1tb read 555 mb s write 508 mb s 2014 model firmware emt02b6q wd black nvme 500gb read 3414 mb s write 2543 mb swd red 3tb wdefrx read 135 mb s write 128 mb seven though the newer drive is slow i am still happy with its performance it is very close to the max speed of a sata iii 6gbps interface i have the 2 evo s for my game libraries and the pro for my os the evo series in has a shorter expected life than the pro series fewer writes which is why i am using it for my game library i expect to only install and not uninstall games regularly while the os drives tend to do more writes i am also using a standard hdd the wd red 3tb for my mass storage like pictures docs and music,runs at 30 degrees c so nice and coolquiet like all ssd sstill fast compared to hdd s,a little slow for some reason see other section,years,2019-04-03 08:28:24,5,2019,4,3

21,excellent drive bas customer service,,these drives are fast and the price is great if you get one on sale,rma process if it needs to be returned has been reported as being very difficult therefore i would consider paying a little more for the intel ssd and avoid that problem later anyone can sell you any thing but service after the sale is everything samsung is the fastest but intel is more reliable and does not have the rma return issue samsung is the best as long as it does not fail to work i do have five samsung drives ranging from 1 month to 2 years old and no problems with any one of them yet i now feel comfortable with their quality and will purchase more of them in the future,,2019-01-07 08:32:16,4,2019,1,7

23,this ssd changed my life,every computer needs an ssd even if its just a boot drive don t deny yourself the simple pleasure of sub 30 second boot times get an ssd today lame 80 s graphics,25secs to boot up moves files from drive to drive really fast loading regular files is way faster can fit a few games on there that i usually save scrub fallout skyrim dishonored games where i load my saves over and over reliable havent had an issue in 3 years,might one day take over the world,years,2018-12-27 23:26:23,5,2018,12,27
24,excellent product amazing first ssd and loving it no regrets highly recommend samsung over others,if you were planning on getting an ssd don t get anything less than a samsung 850 evo in rust steam game my load times to load into a server went from 3 18 minutes sec on the mentioned hdd above to literally 1 minute on the 850 evo saved me between 15 23 seconds on boot up as well take my word if you never owned an ssd like me and this is your first time there are 2 things i highly suggest you do and you won t regret 1 don t buy the 250gb version skip that and don t get anything smaller than the 500gb version my first ssd and i love it i bought the 250gb version and when i saw how fast it was i returned it for the 500gb version 2 days after 2 don t buy anything other than a samsung ssd they are some of the best ssd s in the market when compared and comparing samsung 850 evo and other samsung s ssd to other brands the 850 supersedes the other ssd brands by at least 12 15 minimum i thought ssd s were just hype but i was wrong until i tried it no regrets on my purchase not sponsored just a normal gamer on a budget i7 6700k gtx 970,super fast at least 3 times faster than my wd 2tb 7200rpm black hdd small and very light bigger than a credit card by an inch or so easy to set up and install basically plug and play very simple,no cons at all highly recommend the samsung 850 evo over any other brand ssd,,2018-12-16 12:36:11,5,2018,12,16
25,this is the only model i buy this and the 860,i use these in my laptops side pc s and main pc obviously opt for the 860 or the 970 nvme drives rather than the 850 but if you do it for the cost the 850 is still a great thing,samsung drives are fantastic using them for years without issue very fast for the price,none that i know of,year,2018-11-30 11:22:59,5,2018,11,30
26,amazing if you never owned an ssd before like me you are missing out just amazing,2 quick and very important rules you will thank me for it 1 don t cheap out and buy anything less than a 500gb ssd 2 do not buy any other ssd other than the evo serier 850 and up trust me if you look on reviews online the 850 evo outperforms every other ssd on its category by at least a minimum of 10 12 if not more my only regret not buying the 500gb version instead of the 250gb bottom line yes its a bit expensive but only slightly compared to the boost your computer gets compared to my wd black 2tb 7200rpm hdd this thing is lighting fast no regrets on my purchase can t believe i waited to almost 2019 to believe all the hype loving it,love it when people say its fast its literally super fast i think i boot into windows 7 in less than 13 seconds and that s after typing my password and all games load way faster now significantly faster instead of waiting 30 seconds for a game to load any game almost it loads in less than half the time,none read others worth the price tag,,2018-11-26 18:21:30,5,2018,11,26
27,4 years of service,it s a very slim piece of hardware i didn t even mount it it just sits on top of my old disk drive,has worked great,in the past year or so i have noticed that my boots have slowed down a bit when i first got it i would have to memorize and spam the boot menu on the bios or find myself at the windows login screen this was impressive now despite having a timed bios display option booting up the pc is not instant or as impressive as it used to be,years,2018-11-26 14:48:25,5,2018,11,26
28,get something else,samsung is awful,faster than a normal drive,failed after about a year wont boot bsod tests show bad blocks failing smart uncorrectable error count fail ecc error rate fail,years,2018-11-23 22:49:12,1,2018,11,23
29,been using as primary drive for 7 months with no problems,samsung is proud of their products and the prices reflect that it is expensive for 250gb but it hasn t failed me yet,its solid fast no problems after 7 months,setup can be a pain but thats not samsung or newegg fault its microsoft have to go through so many different windows to get a new drive to work if doing a clean new install of windows then no problem at all windows install will see new drive,years,2018-11-14 09:18:25,5,2018,11,14
30,great ssd,included software is helpful but not really needed i will probably buy another if it goes on sale again,faster than older 840 pro i had been running,had trouble getting my system to see it initially had to play musical chairs with 3 other sata devices might be my board but that is brand new and it saw other devices in the slots i had them edit totally was my board apparently the sata 0_3 and 0_5 are disabled if you use the m 2 port i switched stuff around and it worked fine,year,2018-11-07 06:44:22,5,2018,11,7

36,works great and reliable,i would recommend going for the 850 pro and that s only for the warranty the evo has a 5 year warranty and the pro has a 10 year warranty for around 25 00 more you can t even replace the drive that cheap plus if they warranty it that long they must feel it will make it best warranty i ve been able to find so far,put it to work with a clean install of windows 7 pro right out of the box without a single hiccup noticed a significant increase in system speeds and a decrease in boot times highly recommended,none so far,year,2018-09-29 06:08:10,5,2018,9,29

38,worth the money if,i ve been very happy with the ones i put in my computer and the ones i use for backups while hdds are far more cost effective their weight and size were creating problems for my old carcass not having to lug around and find room for a bunch of backup hdds made the cost worthwhile for me never mind that i ll be eating mustard sandwiches without the bread for a long time not everyone will be able to justify that expense the increased speed when moving large amounts of data was a happy bonus for me however samsung has since replaced the 850 series with the 860s i recommend them over the 850s for lower price rather than buying new 850s there would be no benefit to replacing perfectly good 850s with 860s though,small size light weight no moving parts to wear out or break impact resistant low power consumption generates little heat large capacity and greater speed,cost,years,2018-09-22 00:15:29,5,2018,9,22
39,two years in still perfect,,still as good as the as the day i got it according to samsung magician read write speed didn t fall of much or at all its fast,none that i can think of,years,2018-09-18 21:31:24,5,2018,9,18

85,gets faster the more you use it,i d recommend this if you can find it for sub 140 get the newer 3d nand one other wise,looks great very fast and it actually gets faster windows 10 took 15 seconds to boot after a fresh install after a week of use that number is down to 7,beware that after partitioning and installing windows you ll only have around 460gb to work with,year,2018-02-18 13:04:02,5,2018,2,18
86,great drive,i haven t tried any of the other ssds because these have a great reputation and haven t let me down yet,extremely simple set up comes with a cable that makes it absurdly easy to clone your c drive onto this to make this your boot drive hardy and running well i have one of these in each of 3 desktops and 1 laptop for 2 years and none dead yet my company also installed them as boot drives in each of our dozen or so other work pcs 3 years ago with no issues,cloning instructions are a little confusing says that any info not cloned will be wiped from the source drive which is wrong so i wasted time backing up 500 gigs of data to another drive that was over what i wanted on the boot drive and it does not come with a drive tray so can be a pain in the rear to strap into place in the case or you have to leave it loose,years,2018-02-18 09:25:27,5,2018,2,18

91,great ssd looks great,if you are looking to make improvements to your pc and don t have a ssd yet i would highly recommend one because they are just soo much faster than a by putting your os on one of these bad boys you can start up your pc in just a few seconds as a recommendation if you only plan to keep the os on the ssd you wont need 500gb to do that,price very fast make sure your load your os on here looks very nice in case,none,year,2018-02-13 06:47:59,5,2018,2,13

93,great product easy to setup and super fast,i highly recommend this money wise this is the best upgrade you can make on your computer if you do a bit of everything on it personally i do everything from social media sites to watching movies to video games mostly video games if you hate loading times as much as me get this if you hate low fps and like good graphics get a gpu first then this also keep in mind ssd s are very sturdy and highly unlikely to break down or be defective unlike many graphics cards which have a much higher chance of having problems later down the road or being defective a bit off topic here but i highly recommend the nividia geforce gtx 960 it runs cool it is sturdy and it is well worth the money will play anything you throw at it on ultra if you have the processor to keep it from bottlenecking,it will download on my old stock mobo at 400 mb s per second i went from waiting sometimes 2 minutes for stuff to load all the way to waiting at most 12 seconds after i installed my new graphics card the longest i wait now is 7 seconds it takes 10 seconds to restart my computer 5 seconds to boot it 3 seconds to load gta 5 about 12 seconds before i installed my nivida geforce gtx 960 and 4 seconds to load fallout 4 on medium graphics settings and 7 seconds on max settings that should give you a general idea of how fast this bad boy is keep in mind load times are affected mainly by ssd however gpu cpu and ram also play a role in this so times are subject to change depending on system hardware edit over 1 year later and this bad boy is still working like new only a few bad sectors dont freak out this is normal but at the rate its going it should last around 20 years for me literally ssds last nearly as long as ram if not longer,none so far,years,2018-02-10 15:42:38,5,2018,2,10
94,great ssd,i had to disconnect and reconnect the drive a few times when trying to find a good mounting position cable management the connection board not the connections themselves if that makes sense feel a bit creaky loose i m not concerned now that it s mounted but it was a bit nerve racking as i did fear it might break off never experienced this before that aside the samsung evo series is fantastic tons of reviews and benchmarks out there so not much else for me to add although you pay a bit of a premium for samsung products for a few extra bucks it s well worth the piece of mind that i m getting a quality product i recommend these drives to all my friends customers you can t go wrong,great speedsgood price,nothing really was slightly concerned about the connection see additional comments,month,2018-02-04 20:08:03,5,2018,2,4

193,great product easy to setup and super fast,i highly recommend this money wise this is the best upgrade you can make on your computer if you do a bit of everything on it personally i do everything from social media sites to watching movies to video games mostly video games if you hate loading times as much as me get this if you hate low fps and like good graphics get a gpu first then this also keep in mind ssd s are very sturdy and highly unlikely to break down or be defective unlike many graphics cards which have a much higher chance of having problems later down the road or being defective a bit off topic here but i highly recommend the nividia geforce gtx 960 it runs cool it is sturdy and it is well worth the money will play anything you throw at it on ultra if you have the processor to keep it from bottlenecking,it will download on my old stock mobo at 400 mb s per second i went from waiting sometimes 2 minutes for stuff to load all the way to waiting at most 12 seconds after i installed my new graphics card the longest i wait now is 7 seconds it takes 10 seconds to restart my computer 5 seconds to boot it 3 seconds to load gta 5 about 12 seconds before i installed my nivida geforce gtx 960 and 4 seconds to load fallout 4 on medium graphics settings and 7 seconds on max settings that should give you a general idea of how fast this bad boy is keep in mind load times are affected mainly by ssd however gpu cpu and ram also play a role in this so times are subject to change depending on system hardware edit over 1 year later and this bad boy is still working like new only a few bad sectors dont freak out this is normal but at the rate its going it should last around 20 years for me literally ssds last nearly as long as ram if not longer,none so far,years,2018-02-10 15:42:38,5,2018,2,10

238,greate ssd the included software not so much,i would definitely recommend this ssd don t use the cloning software that comes on the disk with the ssd i used easeus todo free and it worked much better you will need some sort of sata to usb enclosure or something else to connected it to your pc and clone it as well get it on sale if you can which shouldn t be a problem since it often is,very fast replacement for my 4 year old laptop hdd it literally boots in 5 seconds and has no slowdown from the drive whatsoever my hard drive is actually faster than my internet now easy installation capacity is perfect for a laptop unless you have crazy large games or media files,not worth taking an egg off but the included cloning software is not the best it seemed to work fine but after 4 hours of cloning my old drive it froze at 99 and i had to cancel it i ended up using a free software to clone the drive at it worked perfectly and in less than 2 hours,month,2017-12-30 10:32:24,5,2017,12,30

244,still my all time favorite ssd s,i would highly recommend this for anyone who s on the fence or thinking about trying one coupled with a genuine mobo that has genuine sata 3 6 on board your start time will easily be less than 30 secnds form cold dead to on the internet my most recent build has a 16 second cold start to internet time frame that means i push the power button and i m on the internet in 16 seconds flat no joke at this point the only reason i even use hdd s is for bulk storage only,having started with an ssd back in the early 2000 s 64gb i ve been using them since then even with the previously higher cost to me it just made sense rather than to spend so much time waiting for an hdd since i m on my computer for 8 10 hrs a day either researching or working on other computers through remote access the amount of time saved cumulatively was well worth the cost and now that they re even cheaper and bigger all the better i had been a user of ocz brand as well as a few san disks and even a mushkin here and there so i ve been across the board with them ocz s always gave the best performance and reliability but were a little bit more expensive most of the time when samsung decided to start manufacturing their own i gave them a try since they had a better package and performance software included never looked back the trim feature works very well and the performance is always good one thing you ll find out with most ssd s is once they get about 1 2 to 3 4 full the speed performance degredates a little but is still faster than a 12 000 rpm hdd i also like the brushed aluminum black finish it goes into any colored case and always looks good performance is excellent and muc lower power consumption than hdd s to me these should be in every laptop too,none ever this is 8 i also build computers for my customers,month,2017-12-28 21:19:51,5,2017,12,28

262,not for write heavy tasks,for most home computer users this model is a popular choice and rightly so however if you want to copy lots of large files like movies extended video clips databases etc you may wish to consider a different model that s because when writing saving very large files the performance of the 850 evo is drastically reduced this is a limitation of tlc type nand in general currently the best ssd model for write heavy situations is the sandisk extreme pro which uses the inherently superior and more durable mlc type nand chips and is backed by a 10 year warranty interestingly the sandisk extreme pro is only a few dollars different in price from the 850 evo and way cheaper than the 850 pro you pays your money and takes your choice as they say,update 12 18 2017 someone mentioned that when they needed help from samsung they were unable to easily find contact information surprised by that statement i checked the warranty tab next to the reviews tab right here on the 850 evo product webpage the warranty has a link to samsung support website i clicked on it and the samsung support website opened immediately with a toll free number prominently displayed not so hard to find after all 3d vertical nand provides good performance from otherwise inferior tlc type nand chips samsung software borrows some of your computer s ram memory as a cache to boost short term performance,samsung are trying to avoid repeating their earlier mistake when their tlc type nand chips began losing customers data if their computer was powered off for an extended period not surprisingly that upset many users and samsung worked hard to overcome the design fault so far the newer 850 evo does not appear to suffer from that problem and yet cutting edge tech invariably has a surprise or two in store for early adopters,,2017-12-18 00:58:52,4,2017,12,18

271,2 doas back to back,i was really excited when i purchased this ssd and really needed it to replace my old corsair ssd which i used for several years unfortunately i was sent a doa and when i submitted an rma it took 3 days for newegg to send me a shipping label but that was only after i got fed up with waiting for the emailed shipping label and contacted their customer service department it then took a week for them to recieve and process the rma for them to send me another doa i really wanted to like this product but at this point i have lost so much confidence in newegg and samsung,can t really tell you since i bought a defective one on black friday only to get it replaced a week later with another defective unit,see above,month,2017-12-12 21:40:34,1,2017,12,12

276,best improvement,highly recommend this drive i can t vouch for longevity yet but the 5 year warranty is awesome this was the single best performance boosting upgrade i have ever done win 10 boots to password screen in 18 seconds i used to always put the computer into sleep mode to decrease the time waiting for a start up now i shut it down completely because the boot up is so quick the only negative so far was the included data migration software it didn t work first attempt it locked up at 1 second attempt it cloned the drive with no issues 100 but took hours for about 150 gig of data and one problem it would not boot not matter what i tried to do i also found it a little weird that the installation instructions want you to connect it with an adapter which is not included of course to an external usb port to transfer the data first and then install it onto the sata bus why that is probably why it takes so long to copy data over after many attempts in various ways i gave up and downloaded a third party free clone software and it migrated the data in less than one hour and booted right up and did this with it installed on the sata bus just disconnect the source when done you might think the company that makes the drive and includes proprietary software to manage it would make sure it works with it i see others here have had success with it i guess it is some hit or miss thing depending on different drive interfaces maybe but i won t knock off any eggs because of that because the main deal is the performance and not only the boot up time but every application flies you wont be disappointed with this drive,small footprint and lightweightsuper fast,included migration software didn t work,month,2017-12-11 18:26:11,5,2017,12,11

286,product is as functions however,i will not be ordering a sticker from some outsourcing seller instead i will just switch preferred ssd suppliers to a like product with the flair i require with my purchases,im knocking off 3 stars because samsung no longer puts stickers in with their products so that i can label my builds appropriately i like clean and concise and all my previous builds came with ssd sticker i contacted samsung and they said they do not make them anymore so that s that however you can go online and find them for sale by vendors so either someone is making them or samsung outsources them either way not impressed with this line of marketing,no sticker call me oldschool but this was a first for me to see this so i was unimpressed just seems like a cheap move for a company that doesn t make the cheapest product,week,2017-12-04 11:03:00,2,2017,12,4

296,drive stopped working,my understanding of ssd s is they are not as prone to failure compared to hdd s since there are no moving parts all of my hdd s have far outlasted this ssd and generally you start to see when a hdd is going to fail based on my experience when this ssd failed there was no indication of an impending failure only experience a lack of response followed by a re boot my computer would not progress past the post which i assumed was due to a motherboard or ram failure wrong assumption the failure to complete post was due to the malfunctioning boot drive ssd and resulted in spending 1000 to replace motherboard and cpu which also would not complete post using the dead ssd not sure if this is a anomaly or an indication of poor quality by samsung irregardless i will not purchase another samsung ssd,performed well while for approximately 1 year,this ssd died without any notice after approximately 1 year of operation the samsung ssd was purchased based on recommendations and reviews however my experience was not very good,years,2017-11-28 17:20:04,2,2017,11,28

317,total failure of a drive,i understand that you can get a lemon with any computer part i have been building systems for years been there done that but most of my experiences in the past have been that if a product is doa from the get go the manufactures have always replaced it with another new product being sent an item that has already been a problem for someone else regardless of having been fixed leaves me feeling short changed i would not recommend buying one of these drives and yes i am sure that there are just a ton of people out there that have had no problem with these ssd s but my experience has been nothing but trouble and as i stated above already i doubt that i will be purchasing samsung drives in the future,cannot think of any,i have used samsung hdd s over the years and had good results with them this was my first try at a ssd looking to speed up boot up time not from the very get go has this product worked well if at all i had to fight it to get windows 10 home installed and in less then a day the drive had read failures went through all the usual repair attempts all of which did not help fooled around with it for a week and then contacted samsung support that was a long drawn out procedure that did not install a lot of confidence for me either after the drive came back to me repaired via a firmware update according to the paperwork i tried again and guess what the same results contacted samsung support again and the gentleman said that he would put it through as a replacement for me sent the drive back in and waited for my new drive yeah well what came back to me was a refurbished drive this i find to be a slap in the face for a new drive that did not work out of the box i bought a new drive and when it does not work out of the box i would think one would get another new drive to replace it so here i am with someone else s problem drive that has been fixed wow how nice of them yes the fixed drive did format and i was able to install windows 10 home on it but the drive sit in the hutch of my desk as i just do not have any faith that it will hold up if i put it in my machine i have already wasted a good month fighting with the original drive i bought i can not see myself buying samsung drives in the future now,year,2017-11-02 11:11:23,1,2017,11,2

324,so far so good,this is my first experience with an ssd so i am not able to compare to other models i ve only been using this for a couple weeks so too early to comment on reliability i am putting this into a computer that has had very high specs for a long time but those high specs were choked out by the bottleneck of a hdd read and write speed now that i have a very fast ssd the computer feels like a brand new much upgraded machine and all of the other hardware of the box finally has a chance to shine i tried a 4tb hybrid drive but i really didn t see much difference from a traditional hdd this on the other hand makes a very noticeable difference in performance i should have done this years ago don t wait like i did get yourself a real ssd for booting and programs it makes your computer sooooo much faster,typical advantages of ssd vs hdd very noticeably faster than traditional spinning platter hdds uses less power 100 silent much lighter than i expected weighs next to nothing i knew it wouldn t be heavy but it was still a surprise how light it is almost feels empty flat black color doesn t interfere with any sort of design in a case if applicable i noticed a lot of recommendations and positive reviews for this specific product when shopping which is why i chose it the seller packaging and delivery time were all pretty good basically plug n play super easy setup,like any ssd the cost per gig is far more than that of a traditional spinning platter hdd if you need to store more data than its capacity you have to have a separate storage drive in my case i had to look up how to relocate the my documents my pictures my videos my music downloads etc folders to a storage drive while still maintaining their native functionality there are relatively easy tutorials that show how to do this all over the internet,month,2017-10-29 13:08:18,5,2017,10,29
325,fantastic ssd with great value,i would definitely buy another one of these and i might spring for the 1tb version next,relatively inexpensive as far as the ssd market goes for the space and sufficient speeds all around,doesn t come with anything aside from the drive which isn t a big deal as you should have some spares ready to go for mounting etc but is a minor inconvenience,month,2017-10-29 08:41:25,5,2017,10,29

330,well packaged included migration software easy to use works well,i d recommend it for a basic everyday machine but if you ve got a custom rig or a powerhouse you should be running a premium ssd like the 850 pro or something with m 2 if your machine supports it,this drive does the trick to move my dad s aging pre built pc into the modern era it s certainly not the best ssd on the market in terms of performance but given his entire system is running off basic core i3 components no need to get him the cream of the crop the samsung software did the trick without any issues and i m very pleased his pc is running a lot more silky smooth now,i think all ssds regardless of price should come with a sata to usb adapter it s likely a 90 cent add in cable that could make a huge difference,month,2017-10-21 14:00:59,4,2017,10,21

335,do not buy if you have an amd mobo its not compatible,do not buy unless you like frisking around just trying to keep your rig running,sped everything up real nice when it worked correctly,the migration software did not work at all so i had to do a fresh install once win 10 was installed i had problems enabling rapid mode only to find out it is not compatible with my asus amd mobo i had numerous freeze ups where the os would not respond until i did a reboot then after only 3 days i rebooted after another lockup and was all done all i kept getting was a black screen with what looked like the outlook font scrawled across the screen i am trying to reinstall win10 but have decided this piece of junk is going back 340 00 bucks for this i would not put another samsung in my custom rig if it was free going for an rma and another brand,month,2017-10-14 15:52:56,1,2017,10,14
336,works like a charm,got this for my dell inspiron which is now 2 years old it s original hdd went corrupt and then the new hdd i put also started going corrupt since other components were doing fine i decided to try a third time third time is the charm right but this time with an ssd which are renowned for their longevity and it works perfectly now much faster no more 10 mins long windows updates and no more 2 3 min boot times the system boots up in about 15 20 seconds worth the buck if you are putting off upgrading to a newer laptop and want to get a cheap and efficient makeover highest performance vs cost ratio experience with newegg delivery was quick and well packaged no defects in the item before this i got a 960 pro which has even faster speeds than the 850 series however 960 series of samsung requires an m 2 port which my laptop didn t have should have checked before ordering so i returned it and got a full refund minus the shipping so overall the service is good and reliable if your product turns out defective you will you should get a full refund plus shipping from them,perfect fit for 2 5 inch sata gives your laptop pc new life much faster than an hdd system runs much quieter and cooler noticed a slight better battery life as well,expensive maybe,month,2017-10-13 18:40:01,5,2017,10,13
337,,samsung has been making some really nice products lately between this and their usb stick i m liking them,boots system up from pressing the on switch to getting to the desktop in 16 secondsit s fasti like it,pricey but you knew that coming in didn t you i was a little antsy about putting any files on it but i m going to get a secondary hard drive to hold my important files,year,2017-10-12 16:13:49,5,2017,10,12
338,ludicrous boot speed,first ssd on a pc assemble was looking m 2s but saw little difference in load times and higher temps than 2 5 ssds other brands might cost less perform less but if you want the best performance for the price samsung is tops,price speed warranty hardware ease of installation software features best ssd for the for gaming,having to set aside 15 20 of drive so you don t prematurely brick your ssd,year,2017-10-12 12:51:29,4,2017,10,12

340,there is a good reason this drive is so highly rated it works well and it s fast,i have bought a number of different high performance ssd over the years and i have never had more confidence in a ssd as ihave the samsung s,i installed this drive in a asus laptop tp501 install was extremely smooth with the provided software and it works perfectly i tried 2 of the adata su800 s and they both kept bringing me back to the bios setup it just wouldn t work in this asus iused the su800 on another laptop and worked fine there is a compatibility problem there but engineers don t seem toointerested in resolving the problem they will just ship you another drive spend the extra few bucks and get this guy and yourproblems are over crystal mark speed test showed the samsung ran circles around the adata,rarely see these on a descent sale if you want one on sale buy it don t wait like i did and miss the sale,week,2017-10-07 16:14:45,5,2017,10,7

343,love it make sure you purchase a 2 5 to 3 5 adapter for desktop,,i just love ssd s in general this unit comes with software to transfer your current hard drive to the new ssd make sure you purchase a usb to sata cable like the rcuc 16001 if you are installing in a desktop you will need a 3 5 to 2 5 adapter like 9siabr04yt6756 newegg the software included works great to transfer between hard drives just hook it up run the software install your drive and you are running screaming fast on the ssd,samsung s data transfer cd didn t work at all there was something wrong with the cd no worries i just downloaded from their website and installed the software worked great the new ssd booted incredibly fast,week,2017-10-01 13:58:42,5,2017,10,1
344,good value and reliable,,very fast it s an ssd p not very expensive when i got it these evo ssds can be quite expensive though and i have bought cheaper ssds of similar capacities speeds and reliability for less reliable has not caused any issues so far even under frequent use over a year an a half of ownership,can be quite expensive relative to other offerings that are almost as good but significantly cheaper some mushkin ssds come to mind,years,2017-09-30 10:25:31,4,2017,9,30

349,no problems,i m perfectly content with how much i paid for the drive because i ve had issues with cheap drives from other companies,installed it into my laptop quickly have not had any issues with it and it s turned the machine from frustratingly slow to a very fluid experience,i got it at 180 which is a lot more than similar sized drives,year,2017-09-23 14:27:52,5,2017,9,23
350,one of the best ssd you can find,i was skeptical about the pricetag of this ssd being a little higher than the other 2 ssds that i was looking at but i could tell you it was worth it fast silent reliable will look good in your case with tempered glass panel it comes in with software and a 5 year warranty its the best ssd you could find for its pricetag,blazingly fast affordable 250gb perfectly enough for your os and some other important software looks good visually its tempered glass era for pc cases so it actually matters how it looks like with your build,none so far,week,2017-09-22 20:09:06,5,2017,9,22

352,helped give new life to an old rig,i was assembling some old lga 775 hardware but have become spoiled in this day and age of ubiquitous ssd s so opted to not re use my old mechanical hard drives even though i can t use some features of this drive with my old hardware like ahci and samsung s rapid mode it s still exponentially faster than any mechanical hard drive i could ever put in this thing love it never going back,lightning fastsmall physical size,doesn t come with mounting bracket or screws,week,2017-09-20 04:32:38,5,2017,9,20
353,slows way down over time compares to crucial ssd,,it s fast out of the box with good bench mark,according to newegg history i bought this ssd on 9 27 2015 and now two years later i compare it to my crucial ssd which i bought at the same exact time on the same order i remember two years ago i ran crystal disk mark on both the ssds and samsung benchmarks was at least 50 100 mbs faster than crucial but now this samsung is running 100 mbs slower than the crucial ssd the crucial ssd has not changed too much still around 550 mbs read speed but the samsung has dropped to 395 mbs read speed in fact the write speed is now at 405 mbs faster than the read google around and this seems to be a known issue that after some times the samsung read speed slows to a crawl i have downloaded the samsung magician software but that didn t do much at all too bad cannot go back in time and not buy benchmark optimized samsung ssd,years,2017-09-19 16:33:49,2,2017,9,19
354,i am continually amazed,i certainly do recommend this product to any one who wants to breathe new life into your older computer if my wife used her new computer more often i would go ahead and replace her new hard drive with this ssd if the price keeps dropping i may buy them for christmas gifts,super fast transferred and installed without a hitch i still can t get over how fast my old laptop boots up,the ssd is great but you need a cable to transfer all your data between you hard drives the price of it is ok but i had to wait for it to come,year,2017-09-19 15:21:22,5,2017,9,19
355,fast fast and fast,i dropped it while installing it and it still worked it made my heart drop but when used it it still worked this thing is durable unlike other drives where a simple knock would break something inside recommend,fast pc boot about 10 15 secs spacey enough 5 year warranty durable,expensive but it s an ssd,week,2017-09-19 13:28:40,5,2017,9,19

357,great upgrade,the magician software is absolutely pointless i get it the drive works oh and i can see how fast it is maybe i m missing something the data transfer program is nice though,wow what a difference upgrading from a mechanical to ssd is probably the most noticeable upgrade a person can do i used to have to wait for windows 10 to catch up so i could type things in the search bar everything is now snappy quick and responsive and i even have an older processor video card upgrades to the video card made zero difference to day to day usage because the old hard drive was lagging everything now it s like i have a brand new computer worth every penny i can t believe i waited so long,i no longer have time to make dinner while waiting for windows 10 to boot i don t even have time to make a drink the directions tell you to use usb adapters which they don t provide for the initial transfer i just opened my computer and plugged the drive into a free sata cable and the transfer program still worked,years,2017-09-19 08:47:58,5,2017,9,19

360,fast little drive and linux compatible too,i bought this with the intention of installing it on an nvidia jetson tk1 for extra storage and to provide space for a swap file it was essentially just plug and play which is super impressive considering that it is running with a low power arm cpu no driver installs just needed to format the drive and set the system to auto mount it on startup unfortunately there isn t really a way to benchmark with the native tools in such an environment arm cpu modified striped down ubuntu and i didn t feel like writing my own or hunting down one that would work but the whole system is now noticeably faster and smoother compiling code is nowhere near as painful as it used to be thanks to this drive and the swap file it is hosting,painless install on linux ubuntu 14 04 works with an arm processor fast,none,month,2017-09-14 21:13:35,5,2017,9,14

362,better than expected,i bought the samsung ssd to be used as a test to determine if ssds are now suitable for use in small business computers that store customer information i have been a tech for over 40 years which means that over 99 of everything i see is defective customers do not call until something has gone wrong and the memories of the early lcd displays and memory chips still cause me to be very cautious and to not trust any new product i ran the tests on an msi am1m mb with an amd 5350 2ghz apu and 16gb of ram boot speed on a windows 8 1 pc boot speed slowed from the original 12 seconds post bios to the ssd speed of 24 seconds post bios likely caused by the need to load ssd software shut down times remained reasonably similar as a comparison the ssd windows 8 1 boot time is similar to windows xp sp3 loading on the same hardware with a sata2 hdd boot and shut down speeds are not important but they do give an idea of what to expect program speed prefetch is disabled in the ssd software so ms office programs load much slower about 1 to 3 seconds as compared to about half a second on a sata3 hdd and as compared to almost instant on an xp sata2 hdd non prefetched programs like browsers and libre office are much faster around 9 seconds on the ssd as compared to 20 seconds or more on a hdd generally i did not have any wow moments for the ssd s speed but the ssd does make the pc noticeably faster over all security the primary concern is that sensitive customer data must be permanently destroyed when a hdd ssd fails and the only way to destroy the data is by destroying the hdd ssd itself regardless of warranty if a ssd fails the first minute after installation the ssd must be destroyed destroying a 50 1tb hdd is no big deal but destroying a brand new 180 500g sdd is uncomfortable my thoughts the ssd is good for personal computers and i am tempted to install another samsung ssd on one of my other pcs at present until the prices become competitive to hdds i will still not recommend relatively expensive ssds for my thrifty business customers who must store sensitive customer information,quiet low power usage transfer speeds are faster than hdd speeds the cloning and setup software actually works,no cons about 16 months of using as a single drive and everything is still working fine,years,2017-09-13 13:49:06,5,2017,9,13

364,easy to set up plug in clone swap in,replaced the toshiba 1tb mechanical hard drive in my laptop still good just might format it and put it in my ps4 i was lucky that the sata controller on my laptop acer aspire v5 591g had achi already enabled so there was no hassle of making any registry edits or changing anything through the bios all i had to do was plug in the ssd using the usb to sata cable use the samsung data migration software to clone which went through without a hitch and swap in the drive in my laptop three relatively small tasks cloning took about 20 minutes boot up was extremely fast cold boot to desktop screen in roughly 10 15 seconds and an additional 10 seconds to finish up loading system services and the stuff on the taskbar performance is astounding visual studio 2015 and the microsoft office apps open up in the blink of an eye and games are quick to load up and i have yet to turn on rapid mode hopefully won t have any issues with this drive though the 5 year warranty is reassuring will update if anything bad happens,lightweight incredible speeds lower power consumption better battery life for laptops,didn t include a spacer had to get one myself didn t include a usb to 2 5 hdd cable just the bare drive and cd for software installation,week,2017-09-09 20:38:37,5,2017,9,9

370,fried itself in a couple of months,i understand that no product is perfect but having it die so very completely and so quickly should be something that is covered under warranty something longer than 30 days i usually trust samsung but i am going to have to advise against this product simply on the basis of the very limited warranty,seemed to work quite well for a while,died abruptly total data loss tried any number of recovery programs but the superblock was toast and nothing could get past that,year,2017-09-04 09:18:57,1,2017,9,4

532,the best upgrade you can make,i ve been told it is important to not optimize solid state drives as you would periodically for a mechanical hard drive definitely read up more on this so you can properly utilize your ssd,setting this up to be my bootdrive was easy and simple just make sure you hook it up to your fastest sata input on motherboard usually the 6gb s one makes boot up and load speeds incredibly fast as of post i ve had 0 issues with this drive and it s warranty makes me very confident of it s long term reliability,storage space is still limited so having mechanical hard drives is recommended 250gb is probably the smallest you ll want to go for an ssd that being said 250gb is more than enough for the operating system and your most important applications,year,2017-03-05 09:59:36,5,2017,3,5

536,there s a reason samsung ssds are king of the hill a numbe one,do yourself a favor and dip your toes into the ssd pool with a samsung even if you just get a 250gb evo to run your os and a few key games programs you are gonna be smiling from ear to ear you can expect your system to boot up in 10 20 seconds not minutes programs that you ve installed on the ssd will start almost before you click on the shortcut this drive i just purchased is for my dad s new computer he s been running an old dell that has just continually degraded in performance year after year rather than upgrade the system i m building him a new one the key to this new build this ssd with an intel i3 16gb of ram and evo ssd he won t know what hit him instead of waiting 10 minutes to use his computer after booting it up he s gonna be able to sit down press the power button and get right to surfing the internets and perusing the 15 years of email he has archived ain t technology grand,i own 4 samsung ssds that i ve purchased over the period of 5 years or so all are still running solid and all of them are still lightning fast even my 840 evo 1tb drive which has a bad reputation in the industry is going strong after 2 years of heavy desktop use in my experience samsung is the most reliable ssds available fast light weight durable power efficient and pretty darn sexy if you haven t switched over to a ssd from an old fashioned platter ridden hard drive you have absolutely no idea of what you are missing,like all ssds limited lifespan based on usuage not that platter based hard drives are immortal or immune to trouble either just something to know if you write gbs of data every day price per gb is still exponentially higher than platter based hard drives 1tb ssd is around 350 400 while 1tb 7200rpm hds are around 50,week,2017-03-01 22:51:16,5,2017,3,1

549,worked great until it didn t,so sure i d recommend it it was sweet while it lasted and my experience seems to be a fluke but make sure you know what you are doing with your backups and or disk images,small lightweight compact pc build had a dedicated spot for ssd that was kind of cool quick and easy installation quick easy and noiseless operation,died after 16 months translator module went bad that s what the data recovery specialist told me only 600 to get the data off which is good he says the data was all there just inaccessible without his particular skills data recovery you ask well it was my system drive and my backups weren t configured properly or something,years,2017-02-16 17:09:16,2,2017,2,16

601,solid quality works well,this is my second samsung evo ssd the first i bought in jan 2015 is still going strong not the fastest ssd out there of course but you get what you pay for and i feel like this is a solid product you will still notice an increase in speeds especially if coming up from a regular hdd no reliability issues yet,runs great used this as a games drive for a few simulators games i have man what a difference you can t go back to a regular hdd after using one of these got this for a fair price keep your eyes peeled packaging is minimal very small box good warranty you can find other ssds for much cheaper but check their warranties and you ll see why do you want to risk losing your data even so be sure to have a backup drive just in case,box came in a padded envelope squished in the corner edge it works fine but maybe this isn t the best way to ship something so fragile pricey it comes with hdd copying software which i have easily used in the past to copy my original o s hdd drive to a new ssd o s drive however i tried it this time around and learned that this will only work for an o s drive why why have software that can only clone an o s drive what was samsung thinking when they limited the function in this way i took off half an egg for that thankfully there are freeware trial programs out there that you can use to clone a secondary hdd onto this ssd but they really dropped the ball here buy mounting screws if you don t have them samsung still does not ship those with these and you might have a hard time finding them when you need them otherwise i took half an egg off for that too yes some people will have these screws but how much more would it cost them to send 4 with the package for those who don t as an aside try asking best buy or another store for a few extra if you are out of luck and you might get lucky like i did,year,2017-01-04 07:27:12,4,2017,1,4

603,poor life span,can t recommend this drive,while it worked great when it was new the performance fantastic,after a year performance started declining and issues started with lockups i would run a scan and find problems and then repair problems increased and then one day it no longer worked my system kept throwing an error until it totally locked up and could not even be seen by the bios if you want a drive that has a short life span buy one of these or do your self a favor and buy one that has a history of a long life for the cost i guess i expected much more,years,2016-12-30 22:59:26,1,2016,12,30

611,not another stupid review,im surprised to see reviews whining about customer service issues or users display their technical ignorance these people should not leave reviews for this product i see people having the audacity to whine about an ssd not coming with sata cables for an ssd not having software to transfer the os blaming the ssd instead of the raid software for bad raid configurations leaving bad reviews because the carrier lost the package the ssd just works be sure to buy it and register it in the event the ssd fails early if you ve registered the warranty samsung or newegg will replace it with a brand new one simple as that,i own a 500gb 850 evo and a 1tb 850 evo i use the 500gb for gaming only and the 1tb for photo video editing i ve had them for two years and they work the same as on day one much faster than hdd zero noise in my case weighs only a few grams i removed the drive caddy because these drives are so small,none thus far they are fast reliable and the price per gig for as ssd is quite reasonable,,2016-12-28 07:49:10,5,2016,12,28
612,840 evo desktop now 850 evo alienware laptop,if i could afford another 500gb ssd samsung evo i would like to purchase the msata samsung evo 500gb ssd for my alienware so i would have 2 in it for boot and storage without having to take out my dvd if i choose not to however if i did buy the msata i would still want to reinstall the original 750gb hdd back in my alienware for storage as well so i have even more space to use or to use as a dual boot system incase something goes wrong with the ssd to reinstall the 750gb though i would have to buy a cradle that looks like the dvd drive then i would have to remove my dvd from the laptop and use the space for the 750gb hdd,i owned an 840 evo sense 2014 and its still running strong in my desktop to this day and now i have the 850 evo i just bought 11 2016 for my alienware laptop both drives are very fast and if my 850 evo holds up as well as my 840 evo then very reliable as well so far i haven t had any issues at all with either ssd,the biggest con i have with both my 840 and 850 evo ssd s are the migration software i could be wrong but i haven t found any way at all to clone my hdd ssd without having to buy a data cable for such a thing i tried the included software for hours in my desktop trying to migrate clone my hdd with my os installed to my 840 evo ssd and no matter what i did it would not work i even tried acronis cloning software the most up to date version with no luck at all i got so mad it would not work and that every single thing i found on doing it for it to work consisted of having to pay more money for something that if it was needed for the migration of your old drive to your new at the selling price these drives go for they should have come with such cable to do so instead of mislead any and all that don t have this cable by stating its so easy but not mentioning you need the cable to do it i ended just doing a complete fresh install of my os on both my desktop and my alienware cause of this misconception of information about migrating your os from your hdd to your brand new faster ssd i m not going to take a star from this ssd for this lousy misconception of the software because the ssd performs very very well,year,2016-12-27 16:29:20,5,2016,12,27

634,defective after a little more than a year,as many of you reading this i am rather astonished samsung has a very good reputation of course there are always a number of defective units i believe that samsung should be more careful to send a good unit after a defective one has been returned,it is fast,the unit has been defective a little more than one year after i have purchased it i have looked for a way to apply the warranty but i have been unable to easily find contact information after a lot of search and bouncing from one phone call to the other i finally got the phone number to return the defective ssd and i had the 5 year warranty applied the samsung phone number that i have used is 855 726 8721 once i have had the correct phone number the process was easy and fast however they sent me a refurbished ssd i used it for a day when i tried to delete a few files the next day it did not work well ghost files remained i had to reformat i decided to stop using the unit another way to say that i feel that i have wasted a lot of money i must say that i have replaced the samsung ssd by an intel ssd that works great for the moment and that has a reputation for reliability according to an it specialist that i paid to help me with the defective ssd adding to the wasted money,years,2016-12-16 07:36:18,1,2016,12,16

650,i love it,i would recommend this to other people and i already have lol,well the first pro is it is fast and cheap i am actually getting higher speeds than the box says so if you have a decent comp this ssd will be a bit faster than what it says only by 20 30 but hey that is awesome in my book second pro is the samsung data migration program for hard drive ssd cloning was fast and easy to use i got sick of formatting and reinstalling drivers and setting up my comp the way i like it so i used the samsung data migration cloning program and all is well i was going from an older sata 3 ssd from 2012 and it copied 102 gigs in 14 02 way faster than formatting and as i have no issues w my comp cloning was the to go i do not know if the data migration is bundled w the ssd i downloaded mine from the samsung site i also downloaded the samsung magician software to test the speed of the ssd i like the sleek look it is simple but awesome the 3d nand is what drew my attention to it my old ssd has degraded a bit so it is nice to have an ssd back to full speed buy it i did a bunch of research and from what i got out of it the samsung 850 evo line is up to 30 percent faster than its samsung 840 line up,the only con i can think of is the packaging i do not like the ssd on one side while the software is on the other be careful the way you are opening it,week,2016-12-06 04:26:13,5,2016,12,6

685,fast indestructible,,review i ve been using a bunch of these in a nas server for well over a year now without any issues which is unusually when you have that many drives working together with a heavy workload with a proper raid configuration you can get better speeds with a large number of small drives than a small number of large drives going with tlc evos instead of mlc pros will cancel out the increase in cost per gb and maintenance is generally cheaper over the typical lifespan of such a raid array if you re considering pros for high capacity high speed storage you may want to give these evos a try instead,tlc which isn t quite as fast or durable as mlc or slc but this shouldn t be an issue for most users the drive will likely be obsolete before durability becomes a concern and the speed is still amazingly fast,years,2016-11-13 17:08:37,5,2016,11,13

710,title,500gb does not equal 500gb according to your computer allow me to explain all storage devices are measured in bytes but it s not the same byte that your os recognizes computers can only recognize a base 2 numbering system whereas we use a base 10 system the closest value to 1000 that can be reached in base 2 is 1024 or 2 10 hence 1 024 bytes 1 kilobyte1 048 576 bytes 2 10 2 10 or 2 20bytes 1 megabyte1 073 741 824 bytes 2 10 3 or 2 30 bytes 1 gigabytewhat we consider 500 gb is actually 5 10 11 bytes but a computer can only see it as 465 66 gb 5 10 11 2 30 thanks to this numbering system so technically it s not the drive manufacturers who are ripping you off it s a 17th century german mathematician and his obsession with chinese divination that s causing you to lose precious drive capacity it s also the industry fault for standardizing human bytes over computer bytes samsung is one of the only manufacturers to design and build all of the components inside their ssds giving them a significant cost and development advantage as all aspects of their ssds can be controlled in house only toshiba and intel have this top down control over their ssd production although they have used components from outside their company for lower end consumer drives the 850 evo is a product of samsung s industry advantage being the first consumer ssd that combined the affordable tlc flash structure with vertical nand or v nand density in layman s term samsung can not only make cheaper flash memory but they can cram more capacity in each package of flash memory reducing the number or flash packages needed for certain capacities and further driving down costs the 850 evo comes in both 2tb and 4tb versions thanks to the benefits of vertical scaling in flash capacity increasing both the capacity of each flash die and the density of dies per package they use the same number of flash packages as the 1tb 850 evo but are able to double or quadruple capacity thanks to this increase in number of dies and die capacity per package this may soon affect prices of future 850 evos under 2tb right now the 500gb samsung 850 evo uses 4 flash packages with 8 dies per package and a total capacity of 128 gigabit or 16 gigabyte per die that s 32 dies of 16 gigabyte each or 512gb of total capacity approximately 12gb is left out for over provisioning so that s 500gb of usable storage or 465gib of actual storage if samsung chooses to trickle down these denser nand packets the next iteration of the 500gb 850 evo will only have 2 flash packages with 16 dies per package and 16 gb per die based on the 2tb evo or even a single flash package with 16 dies and 32gb per die based on the 4tb evo whether that will lead to a significant price drop is yet to be seen since the denser die packages in the 2tb and 4tb evos are between 4 to 6 times the cost of the older evos packages,i think the internet is unanimous is pinning this drive as the standard to which all other tlc nand drives shall be judged it has the sequential read and write speed that rivals more expensive mlc nand prosumer drives but at a middle of the road cost samsung claims that the 500gb 850 evo could survive up to 150tb of writes in its lifetime that seems rather conservative as the nand wear i m experiencing on my most used 850 evo is 10 4tb total writes and it s b1 smart value is only 16 it s still at 100 of its total write lifespan even after 10000 hours of use i think the actual tbw lifespan for my oldest 850 evo could be up to 1200tb of writes your mileage may vary that s 48000 cycles of rage induced game uninstallation and subsequent buyer s guilt reinstallation still left in this tiny black box the higher write endurance would also explain the 5 year warranty on this drive it s not industry leading but it s much better than the 3 year warranties offered by nearly all of the 850 evo s competitors i liked it so much that i bought it twice,there is a problem with all tlc nand ssds whether they re planar or vertical low write speed and low write endurance low write speed a single tlc short for triple layer cell holds 3 bits of data over an mlc s multi layer cell s 2 bits that s 50 more bits of data over an mlc so it only needs two thirds of the cell count per die to hold the same amount of data but that extra bit means that a tlc holds 8 different states of charges in order to store information 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 an mlc only holds 4 different states 00 01 10 11 when an ssd reads from its flash cells it has to check each possible charge state in order to properly read the data so an mlc cell has to be checked for just four states but a tlc cell has to be checked for eight this triple bit charge state check doubles the amount of time it takes for the flash controller to check each cell hence why tlcs are inherently slower to read and write from this is also why almost every single consumer tlc nand ssd will have some sort of fast cache or memory installed next to the flash controller or integral to the flash packages and the 850 evo is no different it features the same turbowrite technology from the 840 evo where the cache is just parts of the tlc dies unlike the rest of the cells in the die these section of cells act like single layer cells or slcs as they store one bit per cell 0 or 1 rather than three making it four times as fast as tlcs and twice as fast as mlcs in the 500gb 850 evo this faux slc cache is just 6gb so any writes that exceeds this cache will revert to the tlc natural write speed you will only get the advertised 520mb s write speed and 90k random 4kb write qd32 within this 6gb cache the bright side is that the 500gb and higher 850 evos have a much more robust write performance compared to other tlc ssds sustaining 350 400 mb s on my two 850 evos after the cache has been exceeded i m not certain if it has to do with the fact that the ssd s mgx controller is fast enough to swap freely with the slc emulating cache or if each nand die on each package can be accessed much more efficiently but this is still within cheap mlc levels of write performance decent mlc ssds will probably perform much better in raid0 thanks to their higher write consistency low write endurance back to the three bit density of a tlc a single cell can hold 50 more bits than mlc but can only last a fraction as long because of it cell wear due to writes is actually wear caused by electrons migrating through the die in order to change charge stages for a write the cell must have a neutral charge in order for the charge states to be properly read but it can gain a negative charge over time as electrons get trapped inside the cell walls in order to compensate for this the voltage used to read the charges has to be increased to a specific level where the charge states can be properly read again imagine continuously adding salt and lemon juice into a soup to get the taste just right at some point you ll need to pour more water to reduce the salty citric flavor thanks to the increasing amount voltages needed to read the charge states there is a snowballing degradation of the cell as the charge state check takes longer and longer until the controller gives up on that cell and renders it useless to follow on the previous analogy adding more water causes the soup to take longer to boil again until your soup becomes a lukewarm flavorless briny lemon water and you pour the entire pot down the drain because tlcs are able to store more bits per cell you re adding an additional teaspoons of salt and lemon juice over the two teaspoons for an mlc your soup will become a disgusting lemon brine that much quicker compare the 850 evo s tbw lifespan with that of a similar capacity mlc ssd and you ll note that the expected life of those drives is often two to three times of that of the 850 evo even though neither of my 850 evos have lost a single percent of their wear lifespan that by no means implies that wear leveling will progress at the same rate for the rest of their lives the 150tb tbw samsung publishes might be a conservative estimate but a reported tbw rating is the lowest endurance that this product can handle don t take it lightly if you need longer guaranteed nand endurance look for mlc ssds from reputable manufacturers they will cost more and might even have slower reported speeds but there is no substitution if you push your ssds to the limits every day,years,2016-10-21 20:03:58,5,2016,10,21
711,updated died in less than 1 year of low use,currently going through the warranty return service which i guess is nice but i didn t pay more money for an ssd that would need to be repaired in less than a year one of the biggest reasons to buy an ssd is because of the sustainability of it due to no moving parts overall a pretty crummy experience will update once the issue is resolved,was great while it worked fast speeds easy to use etc,purchased it october 26th 2015 then on october 20th 2016 i came home to it 100 dead it isn t recognized as a storage device and doesn t work with multiple different cable setups tried whenever i try to bootup i just get the screen asking me to select a boot device which the ssd is no longer on that list considering it hasn t moved in my setup in months i m inclined to believe it s some kind of defect,year,2016-10-21 08:44:51,1,2016,10,21

713,super slow random read and write speeds,first i have used ssd s for many years now and have installed them in everything from gaming rigs to simple laptops i always run ssd s and no longer use any traditional hdd s whatsoever i have purchased crucial ocz munchkin and samsung ssd s typically the samsung benched the best but overall i have found that all of these other ssd s offered similar performance while in use and only really showed any difference in benchmarks sizes used were from 120g to 500g and everything in between now my problem with the 500g samsung evo 850 i installed this as an upgrade to my evo 850 250g drive if you read the specs the 500g drive shows a slight improvement in performance over the 250g but not much still the last thing i thought would happen is a huge drop in random read and write speeds these drives were both installed on an asus maximus vi hero motherboard with a i7 4790k cpu and low cas 8 1866 ram running on win 10 pro 64 bit i cloned the 500 g off of the 250 g using the samsung magician software the 500g speeds were 553 sequential read 528 sequential write decent speeds but the random read was down a bit at 71297 still not horrible but not even close to the 250g speeds the random write speeds were only 28610 btw that 28k number is the best i have ever managed with this drive the 250g 850 has 548 sq read 521 sq write 96887 ran read and 82967 ran write first i thought maybe a bad cable so i swapped the drive cables so that the 500g drive was using the same cables from the 250g and was even connected to the same sata port as the 250g was previously reran test same results from both drives the 250g performed great but the 500g drive still had the pitiful random performance as a result i contacted samsung support to see if they could offer a suggestion as to what was going on here i got the usual did you do this and did you do that responses no help whatsoever also their responses made some suggestions like what port was it in do you have a bad cable or connection clearly ignoring the simple and obvious fact that the 250g performed properly when connected to either of the sata ports while using either sets of cables so i m thinking maybe the cloning was to blame so now i m not wanting to wipe the 500g 850 so i decide to try all of the possible issues with windows setup no matter what settings i tried the drive speeds remained the same at least they are consistent so now i m left with the last option wipe the disk reformat and see if the cloning was to blame the 500g drive is now th storage drive with the 250g as the boot os drive i downloaded some games from steam after setting up the drive in disk management and reran the test again same horible random read and write speeds as before no change whatsoever clearly the disk is defective and it s poor performaance has zero to do with setup or cloning just a big waste of time thanks samsung my time may not be super valuable but it is worth something to me,it s black,poor random read and write speeds first with os cloned then wiped the ssd and used it as the storage drive without any os installed still same poor performance really disappointed samsung was absolutely no help whatsoever would not recommend samsung after the pitiful assistance they offered,year,2016-10-15 09:11:13,1,2016,10,15

734,blazing fast i should have upgraded years ago,if you re even remotely thinking about an ssd and have the money to spend on one i d recommend you do it get enough storage for your os and your frequently used and resource heavy programs keep your mechanical drive for storage like games movies pcitures whatnot and enjoy the blistering load times,this is my first ssd and i don t know why i waited so long i knew when i freshened up my gaming rig i was going to reinstall on an ssd and just needed to decide which one to go with the overwhelming majority of reviews and suggestions seemed to recommend the samsung evo 850 so i gave it a go it s astonishing how quickly my system boots loads background processes and is ready to go no more waiting on chrome s bloated processes to load up before i can open a browser no more waiting to open resource intensive programs like photoshop or lightroom this thing is ridiculously fast even installing programs is blazing quick now this is one of the best computer related quality of life improvements i ve made,i can t think of a single thing i dislike about this drive well maybe one thing all storage drive manufacturers do it but the advertised capacity and the usable capacity are not the same i got the 500gb model and only 465gb are usable for storage it s not a big deal to me but it s just a thing that the industry does,month,2016-09-24 00:42:28,5,2016,9,24

736,best decision i have made in a while,you can t go wrong with this product and you won t regret the purchase once you start using it,i bought this ssd a couple of months ago and i couldn t be happier with my purchase i pretty much bought this drive so that i could install my entire steam library on not just one drive but on an extremely fast drive as well my library used to be installed on 2 different drives most of which was on a hdd the other ssd that was only a 128gb model and it was the drive i used for my windows boot drive i had all my programs installed on that drive so i didn t have much room left for my steam library except for a couple of small games games like gta v was stuck on a hdd which you don t need me to tell you that it was very slow to load now with my entire library on this ssd every game loads in a fraction of the time so if you re looking to put your steam library on a super fast drive like i did or even to use as a boot drive to run you computer faster you can t go wrong with this ssd i know i will buy another one if i need another one in the future so go ahead and buy one you won t regret it,it wasn t free,year,2016-09-22 20:59:03,5,2016,9,22

738,super fast awesome upgrade,bought this as an upgrade for both my and my wife s pcs replaced a crucial m4 128gb in my machine and is accompanying a wd 1tb drive in my wife s drive installation was completed in a couple minutes on each machine and cloning took about 15 20 minutes the samsung cloning software was a breeze to use i imagine i could have used something better with more options but it did the job and did it in no time flat unhooked the old boot drives rebooted and everything just worked,samsung cloning software got me up and running in about than 20 30 minutes easy to install pretty reasonable size for os and my most played pc games,nothing that i can think of,month,2016-09-21 14:32:32,5,2016,9,21

741,basic great easy ssd,buy one enjoy it was that easy i get 10 seconds power off to ready work on my windows 7 64bit system that i built for a work pc and all the programs hire up way fast than my gaming riggs,well if you have not tried a ssd on your system there is little you can do that will be such a visible boost in performance this is my first ssd and everything went just as it should no drivers needed easy install and best of all super speed,only con would be the price to size because obviously you can get a bigger hhd for the same price that would have much greater storage but you throw away your super speed for storage so in a cheaper system you can chose big storage speed or pay more and get more when the price of this tech comes down there will be no cons,month,2016-09-18 19:12:48,5,2016,9,18
742,great drive lousy software,when i built my son s system i put in a 1 tb hard drive and partitioned it into two 500 gb logical drives i suspect this is a somewhat common occurrence i setup the c drive with the system and he used it for productivity programs the d drive is mostly for games given the size of games the d drive became full in addition his boot time seemed to be excessive thus entered the 500gb samsung 850 evo the physical installation was simple one just has to make sure one has the cables and mounting hardware his case did not have a 2 5 inch bay but mounting hardware is dirt cheap one thing i would recommend is when purchasing sata cables get ones that are angled 90 on one end after the physical install come the problem the software that samsung provides will only do part of the job and that part is not really complete what should happen is that one should be able to run the software have it clone the c boot partition to the new ssd change the ssd to the c drive resize the d drive so it takes the entire mechanical disk without losing any data and change the boot status so the system boots from the ssd this software provided by samsung does not do by a long shot using the provided software you can clone the drive which take a very long time but that is it i ended up using paragon software partition manager 15 which was definitely up to the task given that part of the price is the company s software the ssd is definitely over priced,fast,expensivesoftware not worth the powder to blow it to kingdom come,,2016-09-17 18:42:50,2,2016,9,17

762,cost vs performance increase a great value,i initially tried buying a 250gb ssd and was going to supplement it with a hdd this can be easily done on linux but windows makes it very unpractical i tried this two ways in the past hard links windows search doesn t like this i fear there maybe unforeseen consequences too and via file folder properties moving documents and such to a new drive the latter leaves a lot of data behind in appdata there was hundreds of gigs in there like iphone ipad backups and other stuff i decided it would be easier and i d get more performance doing everything on one big ssd i d suggest the same to you,extremely fast my desktop is a personal build and i ve set out to do some upgrades this is the first upgrade and it is jaw dropping you could save yourself hundreds installing this versus building a new computer it performs better than when it was new don t forget less power and less heat,ssd is far more expensive but costs will continue to fall,year,2016-09-04 10:32:31,5,2016,9,4

792,superior product,when it s up and running do install the samsung magician software that also comes with the drive you will be able to benchmark and tweak the drive most importantly you will need to op over provision the drive for maximum efficiency manually samsung does not do that out of the factory unlike many most other ssd s it s easy to do with the magician suite i set used the recommended 10 setting which does take up about 25gigs of drive space,i d been wanting to buy a new ssd for a number of months to replace my smaller but still able adata ssd that was running out of room my research came up with a number of candidates but ultimately i realized that most drives were still being compared to the samsung evo drives so why get anything else it arrived promptly from newegg and i had it up and running with my cloning software in a couple of hours the thing that took the most time was the physical install in the box that s always a bit of a pain it s up and running perfectly and is noticeably quicker than the adata not by a lot but it is faster to open programs etc boot time is about the same to windows 7 approx 25 seconds,only con is the samsung cloning software it requires a usb to sata adapter for the samsung ssd it won t clone from sata port to sata port only to usb i wasn t aware of that when i bought the drive but fortunately i have acronis trueimage on my computer and used that to clone the drive not using a usb connection which was also much faster,week,2016-07-21 06:35:54,5,2016,7,21

796,,as other reviews have said the box only comes with the drive and a software disk you need to get yourself a cable separately as well as any mounting bracket you want to use honestly though as the drive is tiny and extremely light i found that is pretty effectively held in place just with the stiffness of the cable if that makes sense my case never moves unless i m opening it up so i m really fine without mounting it and you might be too,very easy to install the software that it comes with made cloning my old 1tb hdd really simple i pared my drive down to about 370gb and it took a little less than an hour to finish the clone my boot time for windows 10 on a cold startup had been well over a minute with the hdd probably closer to 2 min but with ssd it is now closer to 15 or 20 seconds itunes also used to take well over a minute to start for whatever stupid reason but is now instantaneous i m not playing any high load time games right at the moment but i m going to get back into fallout 4 soon and i ll try to remember to revise this then,none yet,week,2016-07-17 07:50:35,5,2016,7,17

834,samsung evo 850 amazingly fast,i would definitely recommend getting one if these if you can get it on sale then i d say go for it the joy you will get from your machine running so much faster will be worth it if you are running a gaming machine this might even give you a bit of an edge over your competition since your load time will be much faster than someone on an hdd i hope this review helps other decide if they should get one of these or not cheers,i purchased one of these a few months ago from a local computer shop it was really just a convenience thing the shop was 10 minutes away from me unfortunately the computer shops website is not really good for posting reviews so i thought i d post one here since the newegg site is great for that i have purchased from newegg in the past and i had no problems with the purchases anyways the ssd was placed in to an asus g75v gaming laptop which is approximately 3 4 years old i was impressed by how much faster my laptop was after i replaced my c drive with this ssd the laptop used to have a hitachi 1tb hdd 7200rpm and my laptop used to take approximately 5 minutes to boot to a fully loaded desktop now that i have the new ssd installed it s boot time is less than 1 minute to a fully loaded desktop it could be even faster to boot but i still have one more of the original hdds in the second drive slot used for data storage and that slows down the machine a little without the hdd in drive bay 2 i found the boot time took approximately 30 45 seconds to a fully loaded desktop meaning all my icons loaded in the system tray and the laptop was done loading the various processes and services it was like i brought new life in to the laptop once again everything else worked great and now my laptop was a speedy beast once again i performed a clean install the old hdd was just that old so i figured why not do a clean install on a new drive i have a lot of programs which i installed to my laptop and it took a fraction of the time to install everything compared to the time it took me the first time i setup my laptop when it was new and it had the 7200 rpm hdd as the c drive additionally i also installed the samsung software what came with the ssd to manage it better not sure if that maters or not one more thing to mention i did not install the intel rst driver i have found in the past the rst drive can be buggy and cause all kinds of problems on a machine so i avoided it here is some info on whether or not you need the intel rst driver spoiler alert you don t need it lol http www tomshardware com answers id 700708 intel rapid storage technology software htmllike i said i purchased one of these a few months ago and it is still going strong fast and no errors or any problems from the drive to speak of also i believe the evo comes with a 5 year warranty so that has to suggest they are built with quality here is a link to another review site with plenty of specs in case you were curious http www storagereview com samsung_ssd_850_evo_ssd_review,the only con i can think of is the cost even though they are coming down in price the ssds price per gig is a lot more than a standard hdd a 1tb hdd is approximately 100 whereas a 1tb ssd is approximately 400 or a little less so if you are on a tight budget it might be a hard price to swallow that said it will be worth it if your current bottleneck is your hdd on your machine and you want faster speed out of it once you get over the sticker shock you will most likely be happy with the results,,2016-06-10 13:06:55,5,2016,6,10

864,phenomenal,i understand that ssds have known longevity issues although those have largely been addressed in the current generation and that performance can and will to some extent degrade over time but i m hoping that my first ssd experience will be as positive as my experience with wd hdds has been over the years based on the first day and samsung s reputation i m looking forward to many years of speedy service from this ssd,fast fast fast i ve built my own system for years and lean toward the upper midrange and for years i ve insisted on wd 7200 rpm hdds because of their speed reliability and cost meanwhile i ve been hearing about the ssd revolution in speed and user experience after living with 5 min usable boot times on my win7 core i5 4600k w 8gb ram for several years i ve finally caved to the desire to get an ssd boot drive and my research led me to the samsung evo 850 series the cloning software worked well but i wasn t able to follow the easy setup instructions i ll talk about that in the cons nevertheless once i got the system to boot from the ssd i was blown away my 5 minute boot sequence had been cut to 30 seconds the overall system responsiveness was noticeably improved and i m looking forward to seeing how this lasts,the external usb sata cable depicted in the easy setup instruction sheet to be used for data migration isn t included with the drive as a consequence i installed the drive internally formatted it then cloned my boot partitions long story short i wasted several hours redoing several steps because i wasn t able to follow their ideal installation process and i wanted to keep my hdd for bulk storage installation would have been smoother if samsung had either included instructions or made provision for internal installation prior to data migration or included the 5 10 transfer cable depicted in the instructions so i could have followed their installation process,day,2016-05-20 08:53:11,5,2016,5,20

872,excellent product missing little details,i would definitely recommend upgrading your laptop with a ssd if you currently have a mechanical hd inside just make sure the physical size matches closely or you have the customizing parts on hand actual memory size should be equal to or greater than what you are replacing to make the job easy watch for sales new tech coming out in 16 17 could put this on sale that would be a great time to grab one and upgrade,fast for the use i have for it using acronis true image to clone the drive is a snap and the process only took 15 minutes slightly longer than the actual drive swap in my laptop laptop now feels faster and smoother operations overall in spite of running win 10 on it,samsung cloning software is not up to snuff will only recognize c drive to clone can t recognize any other drives i wanted to clone and replace had to go to 3rd party cloning software nit picking now would be nice if they had included a 2 5mm spacer as most 2 5 mechanical hard drives i have run into are 9mm tall while this unit is 7mm tall just an inconvenience to have to go find a spacer,month,2016-05-16 17:05:54,5,2016,5,16
873,only gets 4 stars because of the awful software drive gets 10 000 stars,five stars for the drive but not sure about the software it could be i have no idea what i m doing or that the software doesn t do something right for uefi stuff i love the drive and apparently samsung has a lot of faith in this technology i am quite satisfied with the speed this ssd is thinner than the 1gig spinning drive it replaced so you may have to get a spacer or mini cage for it,love the speed and the promised durability put into a dell 5000 series laptop 5559 replacing a 1gig spinning drive the results are night and day other than me being too stupid to figure out the software i am more than happy,ok i guess i m stupid but i could not get the transfer software to work well i guess work the way i wanted it i wanted a complete clone but i could not figure it out it said it transferred the data but then the laptop bios would freak out with the ssd cloned data and not load from the hdd i had to load win10 clean from a usb stick to the drive and that seemed to work wish i could have had a clean copy but loading 10 from scratch wasn t bad boots shuts down constant win10 updates don t slow the laptop down any more,week,2016-05-16 15:53:37,4,2016,5,16

881,great so far,i didn t do the migration because my pc s disks had already failed simply connected the ssd inside the computer and did an image restore from an external usb drive if you had a raid setup don t forget to change the sata controller to ahci mode in your bios disk magician will tell you that the ssd wants ahci but then you might need to re image the system again,it s super fast now windows 10 restarts or loads from shutdown in a matter of a few seconds,it s still rather expensive,week,2016-05-12 10:10:05,5,2016,5,12

919,10 10 would recommend over any hard drive,i have already recommended to my friends i loved it enough to buy a second will never buy a hard drive again,unparalleled speed compared to any hard drive was a good price bought it while on sale a much more noticeable upgrade compared to upgrading a gpu cpu etc can tape to my computer case without worrying only had one ssd holder,had a bit of trouble trying to transfer but that problem would probably occur with with replacing any storage device,year,2016-04-14 22:41:08,5,2016,4,14

923,good ssd,i m not sure if i m supposed to download it from samsung s site or not but mine didn t come with those free utilities the ones people are saying they can use their ram as a high speed cache and stuff would be nice to get those edit as of 4 12 16 still running strong i m an lly retentive about how many drives are in my dinky little case as in i only want one in there so i already wish i bought the 1tb instead also i enabled rapid mode and regretted it musta been a bit too rapid for my machine because i had to do a clean install not like i needed rapid enabled in the first place just wanted to see what happened got bubbly from a beverage flipped it on said wow then said cr p still laughing over that one,i don t get into the benchmarking like a lot of people but for everyday use this seems comfortably fast slapped it in fired right up,this didn t come with a mounting plate or screws i didn t knock an egg off because if this were purchased for say a laptop then the plate would be a waste of metal both of my ocz ssd s came with them which was convenient for me personally but for the quality level this thing has been reviewed as i m just nitpicking,year,2016-04-12 20:02:35,5,2016,4,12

931,right sized right priced,500gb capacity is a great middle ground storage choice which allows for many options partition it in 2 or even 3 and use 2 partitions for a dual boot 2 o s setup and leave a partition for storage or image backups of both operating systems with still room for your important file backups storage,i chose samsung s 850 evo 500gb ssd because of the dependability sheer speed of file transfer rates of their drives 500gb makes it a great choice for those who choose to have everything in one place your operating system response time is super quick and you have equally fast access to all of your installed programs or games etc it also works well as a secondary drive to store large files you use on a regular basis samsung does an excellent job at delivering professional quality solid state drives and their included samsung magician software disc allows you to get every bit of speed takes care of firmware updates and allows you to see how your drive is functioning i m running an 840 pro 256gb and 3 850 evo 120 s in 1 case and have yet to notice the slightest lag between the evos and the pro model the evo 120gb is great for those on a tight budget the evo 250gb is an even better bargain if you re willing to spend a few dollars more but the evo 500gb is very reasonably priced costing less than the price of 2 evo 250gb ssds here at newegg in a price per gb comparison and where more storage space is required the samsung 850 evo 2 5 500gb is the way to go,not cons keep in mind that no sata cable screws or other mounting hardware are included this means no bracket again no mounting hardware included this is samsung s standard packaging methodology please keep this in mind if you intend to purchase the evo or any of samsung s ssds and must use any of the above mentioned items there are all sold separately,week,2016-04-09 15:21:59,5,2016,4,9

935,blazing fast,i would absolutely recommend this ssd there s a reason it has so many positive reviews,i bought this solid state drive to upgrade an aging early 2011 macbook pro a lot of what i had read on the internet about upgrading to ssds made it seem like a complicated procedure but this was ridiculously easy the drive popped right in and i didn t even need a spacer now my macbook is a lot quieter it has longer battery life all my apps load instantly and it can pull off a hard boot in less than 10 seconds,no cons just make sure to enable trim if you re upgrading a mac it ll extend the life of your drive and keep it running at an acceptable speed you can do this by opening the terminal and typing sudo trimforce enable without the quotes and rebooting windows users need not go through this step trim is automatically enabled in all microsoft operating systems that support it,week,2016-04-08 02:00:12,5,2016,4,8
936,good investment so far,you will be pleased if you upgrade from a regular hdd to an ssd not just with the boost of speed but also the silence this unit is fast 250gb is sufficient amount of storage from my 1tb hdd don t install unnecessary programs and clean up your files you may have to stick your original hdd in an optical drive hdd tray to keep your large files such as videos on the hdd you see some improvement if you were already using an sshd or a hard drive with 8gb of ssd for cache,fast one of the fastest on the marketcost is acceptable,none so far,year,2016-04-06 23:15:39,5,2016,4,6

940,instant fast computer,i have an older computer i7 950 running on a asus sabertooth x58 it s plenty fast for me but what isn t fast has been the drive after years of accumulating software and updates to windows booting take ages and whenever the games go to the drive for data the hesitation is noticable note that the x58 has sata2 ports there are sata3 but they go through another chip and run slower than the sata2 ports not happy about that asus but even with the slow sata2 ports replacing the drive with this instantly turned the computer into a speed champion again boot times are now single digits of seconds access to the drive is so quick i can no longer get a beer waiting for the world to load in and in music production the effects and instruments are so fast to summon you d think they were already running even those without the sata3 ports can use this drive to supercharge their pc this staves off the day you have to buy another monster computer and when you do the drive here will be even faster in the new machine as well no moving parts means it ll last longer as well as run faster,improved times for everything even if you have an older computer without sata3,price,,2016-04-05 11:49:15,5,2016,4,5

1000,love this drive bought 3 samsung ssds,i d recommend these drives no question about it performance is so far ahead of traditional spinning hard drives that most people simply won t notice the minor speed difference between these drives and much more expensive ssds i ve simply had no real problems with them at all and i am most likely going to buy another one of these if i need another drive or build another new computer i ve already helped guide friends and family to buy these and i haven t had to help them troubleshoot any of them because they work fine and fast,i ve had great luck with my 3 samsung ssds the first one i got was a 750gb evo for my laptop when it was on a great sale and i liked it enough i got a 1tb 840 evo for my desktop and a 1tb 850 evo for my wife s laptop they re super fast and unlike some other ssds the case is thin enough to fit in pretty much any laptop,i have noticed some quirks with the samsung magician software nothing that affects drive performance or reliability but for example on my desktop the samsung magician software keeps shutting down on its own and on all 3 of my computers if you open up magician and have it check for updates it always says it has the latest version even if there are newer versions available for download so the software isn t 100,,2016-03-12 20:44:24,5,2016,3,12

1002,can t go wrong with this ssd,i ve purchased a few of these drives already put one in a laptop another in my desktop it s a good starter drive with a 5 year warranty and honestly one of the only good choices of ssd s right now until nvme matures or another faster sata medium comes out since performance has stagnated,right now due to sata 6gb s every ssd on the market that s recently pretty much saturates the port with performance so that leaves only the reliability of the drive and here is where samsung differs from other ssd ssamsung makes their own memory and controllers which gives them full control over them you can see that in the magician software where you can actually make this drive faster in certain applications samsung also invented 3d vnand which adds more layers to increase durability of the cells themself increasing it s reliability also makes it cheap to make and those savings come to us,none,year,2016-03-12 11:53:57,5,2016,3,12
1003,awesome ssd bundled with great software,highly recommended,the samsung magician software is very nice it automatically updated the firmware when i clicked it configured my os win 10 to work the best with the ssd informed me i was in ahci mode and even verified trim,only wish i had an 10 tb version of this,month,2016-03-12 07:21:40,5,2016,3,12
1004,experience life time of ssd samsung 850 evo,keeping power off still if you have one of these turn off defrag and on during working only keep a mirror on second drive raid 1 when boot gets slow or you see task manager hard drive go to 100 a few times that is the beginning of the end that is my experience do not try to keep working you will loose all data and os limit what you keep on the drive and use at read only as possible,fast boot and operation of programs good price d,download information not for novice or layman i have had two of these units 2014 first unit died in several months second one december 2014 purchase then now 2016 march unit gradually thrashed then no bootable drive message i cannot rely on these for desk top so back to hard dirve i use raid 5 it is best and hard drives are not expensive raid 5 allows failure completely of one drive this is an allowance for safety and low cost even if you use 3 4 drives lap top i may use because of g force damage and increased battery life i need hearty unit if you are expert you should keep up with firmware and download updates these units are internally complex on how they manage the hardware low level,years,2016-03-11 12:28:27,2,2016,3,11

1076,5 star ssd gets 4 star rating because of nonfunctional migration software,i ve used 840 evo ssds in the past and had no problems at all the migration software worked perfectly and quickly however this time around the navigator software wouldn t recognize the drive and kept prompting me to connect a samsung ssd because i d run this before i thought the drive might be bad when neither my laptop nor my desktop could see it the usb would connect but no drive appeared in file manager etc because newegg has no tech support i had to return the drive to find out when the second drive did the same i started looking for solutions eventually i found a post saying that the current release of navigator simply does not recognize windows 10 not sure if that s correct but it went on to tell how to use diskpart to initialize the drive after that windows could see the drive but not navigator so i went to best buy and picked up their standard apricorn cloning software and cable which cloned my hdd onto the sdd in about 20 minutes swapped out the drives and i was in business so great drive awful software it s truly amazing that a huge corporation like samsung can produce a state of the art ssd but somehow can t manage a simple piece of functional cloning software especially when there are many such available for download all over the interwebs just inexcusable really shame on you samsung,quick install super fast,samsung provides their navigator migration disk cloning software that doesn t recognize the samsung drive nor do they provide a usb to ssd cable,week,2016-02-16 16:03:19,4,2016,2,16

1092,samsung 850 evo 2 5 0 gb sata iii,obviously there a lot of great reviews of this product the people who have failed drives after 9 10 months most likely didn t set their bios up correctly to support a ssd maybe there are some defected drives ones out there but you see that same review on all brand ssd reviews will i recommend this product to someone else no reason is if they actually do quality control on these devices how did an empty shell pass that control again platinummicro did a great job in the return process i can t blame them for this drive,platinummicro sent me a return label the same day i made my rma and i paid 0 return shipping migration software is great it seems to be hard coded only to target samsung drives,received the ssd almost a week after all my other pc parts for this build arrived there was no migration usb cable that is mentioned in the migration instruction guide the saddest part and the reason why i returned this product is the fact that the drive itself was empty it was a physically empty shell hallow yes nothing on the inside in 8 years of working in it and receiving 1000s of parts i ve never seen anything like this to say the least i was very disappointed my first review was deleted or never passed moderation it basically stated exactly what i said here if i double post my bad i needed to add in that platinummicro s return policy was great anyways,week,2016-02-10 06:44:39,1,2016,2,10

1094,duct tape may be required for installation,,fast efficient reasonnably priced when on sale,none so far other than the weird installation requirement this drive was thinner than my original hard drives so it goes undetected when you plug into a laptop at least mine since the connectors don t touch after seing a picture of the drive with duct tape on the net we tried it and after 10 layers of duct tape it worked perfectly fine so if you can t put the screw back add duck tape on one side the one opposite the one where the screws go in until you can actually screw the drive properly at that point it should work i wish they d put 1 or 2 mm of extra plastic on the case so we wouldn t have to resort to such crazy procedure,year,2016-02-09 12:40:10,4,2016,2,9
1095,unreliable,i would not recommend this ssd to anyone the amount of work it takes to properly setup a new c drive even when you have backed it up makes this ssd a bad investment of time and money,easy to install fast and reasonably priced,drive failed 10 months after it was installed this was the second samsung 850 evo 250 gb ssd that has failed in the same computer in the last 15 months,year,2016-02-09 12:14:36,1,2016,2,9
1096,product ok the magician and data migration software can confuse,use data migration for cloning not magician the sdd cloning was the simple part on tearing apart and reassembling a dell inspiron duo laptop to get it mechanically installed,seems ok i do not do speed tests,there are two programs in the software magician does not find the ssd for migration apparently is for managing and testing after cloning and installing data migration is the other that does the actual cloning worked fine after i finally chose it took several tries on two pcs to realize the error of my samsung s way with all the references to magician it was not as easy as it should have been used win10 perhaps that makes a difference in what program s names appear,year,2016-02-09 09:28:22,4,2016,2,9

1099,not great,i guess i would recommend it if this product wasn t faulty,only reason i got it was cuz it was suppose to speed up my loading times etc which it did,it also did another thing which was it stalled hang my desktop randomly and then 5 10 seconds later it unfreezes its never occured on my old harddrive before,month,2016-02-09 05:18:35,2,2016,2,9

1116,samsung 850 evo,in order to get an rma from samsung you must send a ridiculous amount of information what a pain in the rear what happened to calling giving them information over the phone then getting an email with instructions for mailing it back to them this is a bunch more work for the consumer when this entire problem is caused by there defective product this process needs to be looked at,extremely fast quite an upgrade from a conventional drive,didn t last broken after only 5 months or so computer will not even post when the drive is plugged in some sort of short i would guess,years,2016-02-03 18:52:17,3,2016,2,3
1117,improved performance over an already speedy pc,now i enjoy the larger and faster samsung 850 evo in my pc i recommend this ssd to anyone if there was anything for samsung to improve i might recommend they continue to revise their samsung data migration software now v 3 0 to clone a recovery partition more reliably,i bought the samsung 850 evo 2 5 500gb as an upgrade from a samsung 840 evo 2 5 250gb ssd on my hp desktop pc between doubling capacity and using the new ssd technology the improved performance over an already speedy pc was significant i can highly recommend the samsung 850 evo 2 5 ssd if you re contemplating your first rodeo to install an ssd i m happy to report the 850 evo ssd hardware was easy to install and know you re buying the drive only not a kit you ll need to supply your own 1 mounting bracket 2 5 sata hard drive to a 3 5 or 5 25 bay the 2 attachment screws a to mount the ssd to the bracket and b to mount the bracket to the hdd 5 25 cage in the pc system unit in this ssd replacement scenario i reused the existing sata power connector from the power system unit and sata data connector from the motherboard also in order to clone the data from the source drive to the new ssd you ll need at minimum a usb to 2 5 sata hard drive adapter cable and the samsung data migration sdm software i say at minimum because you may need as i did disk partition management software i use aomei partition assistant,i spent most of my time cloning the data from the 840 evo ssd to the 850 evo ssd first i used the sdm software to create the system partition and to clone the boot partition with the operating system and data files onto the new ssd also like other my hp desktop has a hidden recovery partition labeled hp_recovery which i wanted to include on the 850 evo ssd the sdm user manual states the oem recovery partition created by the computer manufacturer as a factory setting will not be cloned from my experience the sdm software did allow me to select the hp recovery partition but it allocated way more space than was needed so instead as a second step with both 840 evo and 850 evo ssds still attached to my pc i created a new partition destination ssd the same size as the recovery partition source ssd copied the hp_recovery partition to the new partition and renamed the new partition to hp_recovery this is when i used aomei partition assistant after i completed the cloning operations i tested the hp recovery partition i found it booted into the recovery workspace just fine,week,2016-02-03 18:37:50,5,2016,2,3

1132,samsung 850 evo 2 5 250gb sata iii,this is not pertaining to samsung drives in general but it seems that a lot of people seem to have issues with ssd drives on a regular basis i think a lot of times that are actually system problems other then the hard drive make sure your motherboard and operating system is capable of using ssd type drives first as far as samsung s tech support goes i ve never had to use them yet and have installed several of their drives on my customers system,i recently purchased this drive to replace my aging samsung 840 which was actually performing just fine i needed to increase my storage area install went flawlessly did an acronis image took about seven minutes where would normally take 14 noticed an immediate increase in speed not only in boot time but in overall performance drive was set up gpt with no problems and running ahci mode,as i said this is a recent install so no problems or issues to report yet will follow up with any issuer problems later,week,2016-01-27 18:37:03,5,2016,1,27

1146,these ssd s are lightning fast,i would very highly recommend this ssd to anyone well worth it in my opinion,about nine months ago i bought a 500gb version of the samsung 850 evo for my aging laptop pc even though it has sata ii ports installing the ssd made a huge leap in performance certainly no different with the 1tb unit i bought about a month ago and installed in my homebrew pc with sata iii ports which is over four years old now from a coldstart to the win 7 log in screen used to take an excruciating amount of time now it takes usually no more than 15 seconds or so i suppose there are ways to shorten the boot time even more but i m not gonna bother another big advantage is with resource intensive software such as logos 6 bible software complex searches take about 20 maybe less of the time they used to with my old drive these samsung ssd s are phenomenal,not really a con but when transferring your os to this new ssd it is absolutely imperative that you defragment your source drive before doing so the data migration software supplied is not tolerant of fragmented source drives,month,2016-01-22 19:15:05,5,2016,1,22

1151,made my laptop run like new,,i bought this to replace the hard drive in my year old laptop it takes about ten minutes to install in my laptop depending how knowledgeable you are about those things another hour to reload the os i elected to do a clean install of windows instead of using the included migration software i am amazed at the difference it has made my laptop is an asus tp500la about a 650 computer and it is blazing fast now before this upgrade it took about 30 seconds to boot up from shutdown and a further 2 3 mins for it to load sufficiently to open anything without freezing now it takes about 10 seconds to boot up and be fully functional by way of comparison it boots up just as quickly if not quicker than my dad s 6 month old hp omen a 2000 computer it also opens programs and retrieves information amazingly fast as well i use autocad on this laptop frequently and it opens in less than 10 seconds compared to the several minutes it took with the hard drive i could not be happier with this purchase for 150 you can completely revamp your computer to run just as fast as one that would cost twice as more it is literally like getting a new laptop,product does not come with a sata to usb cable that is mentioned in the instructions as far a performance is concerned though i have nothing but good things to say so far,,2016-01-21 11:30:24,5,2016,1,21

1154,awesome ssd,you re paying for the samsung name and the reliability of the ssd through their reputation,i got it for sale around christmas for pretty cheap so it was great price to performance storage for me it is an ssd and like all ssds they are much more snappy and faster responding than mechanical hard drives the startup time from completely off is like 15 seconds it s incredible,it didn t come with any hardware to install it in your case this wasn t a problem for me because my case has tool less installation for hard drives and ssds it didn t affect me so i don t feel the need to take an egg away but i thought it should be mentioned,year,2016-01-20 13:53:18,5,2016,1,20

1164,a pretty nice inexpensive upgrade,i had been resisting the urge to upgrade to an ssd for so long since i have been more than happy with 7200 rpm hard drives and would rather put money into the most important parts of a gaming pc e g gpu cpu board and ram but ssds have gotten so cheap now it was an obvious upgrade to make for my system i don t think an ssd gives the night and day difference it s always hyped to do at least if you re running decent 7200 rpm drives already but it is an obviously noticeable difference for instance loading a save in fallout 4 seems to take about half the time on this 850 evo as it does on my seagate 7200 rpm drive i had the game installed on before so it s not a huge deal but it s definitely nice to have overall i can highly recommend this drive for a gaming pc as loading is definitely more pleasant with a good ssd than a good hdd,1 my games and programs load quicker 2 windows boots quicker 3 250gb is plenty for installing windows a few large programs e g texlive mathematica visual studio and a few large games while still having 10 free space for over provisioning 4 the samsung magician software is nice for setting up the over provisioning painlessly 5 samsung makes the best memory right now and you know you re getting samsung memory in a samsung drive 6 an ssd makes no noise,1 the 500gb model is probably better for the money if you like to install a lot of games,month,2016-01-17 18:45:28,5,2016,1,17

1282,great drive,if you are migrating your os drive from a spinning disk to the flash drive be sure to manually install the migration tool off of the included cd at which point the data transfer cable will work perfectly since it doesn t need to see a native samsung disk to work,the drive itself installed perfectly and works really well migration tool is simple and very straight forward to use,samsung documentation is utter garbage especially went it came to migrating my os drive on a spinning disk to this flash drive documentation has no text at all and i ordered a data transfer cable based off of the picture documentation no issue there the problems were encountered when i installed the software and the drive was not seen by samsung magician as a samsung disk while connected via the transfer cable which leads to the problem the installation disk only installs samsung magician automatically it does not install the migration tool which i didn t notice until i had given up using the data transfer cable and installed the drive on the sata interface the documentation has no means of communicating that the migration tool requires manual installation and samsung s website provided no additional insight,month,2015-12-15 05:53:54,4,2015,12,15

1321,great drive but horrid software,since i m an advanced user it might have helped if i had some advanced options for drive migration also not all usb to sata connectors will recognize this drive so some additional hard war purchases may be necessary since it is a 2 5 drive you will need to buy a mounting bracket for 3 25 5 drive bays on desktop systems,excellent performance for gaming provides short load times for multiple highly demanding games load screens lasted a fraction of the time they usually do all application and os load times get reduced to barley noticeable times,the software for migration is an absolute knight mare to use when something has gone wrong it dose not like to have multiple partition drives with multiple formats if your good with other clone software you would be better off using that trying to use the provided migration software was more of a head ache than it needed to be what i needed it to do was just a migration of the boot sectors and c of a windows install on a 1 tb drive even when everything was set up the way the software said i should have it the cloning would stall at 99 complete all of the time when it finished no data was on my drive it would not matter how much data was to be cloned tried with a vanilla win 10 install for no luck kind of ironic since it was all for a samsung laptop,month,2015-12-06 20:10:58,4,2015,12,6
1322,less perform than 840 evo pro,i buy the 500 gb samsung 850 evo for clone my 840 evo for having the same size match with acronis,great price and good value for a 500gb ssd,after install it i find that the 500 gb 850 evo model are significant less on write performance comparing to my 500 gb 840 evo specialy on the write iops value by using samsung magician software by trying a few time the performances benchmark approximative results was read write 500 gb 840evo 553 533 55992 46302 iops system256 gb 840pro 555 495 54120 30846 iops500gb 850evo 549 519 53714 19791 iops and this with the same os cloned from my 840evo this results can varie but by less than 20000 iops that s much i think samsung will have to update the firmware like have do with the 840 serie version i can t explain that,week,2015-12-06 15:41:27,4,2015,12,6
1323,only buy as a throwaway,just buy the off brands for 40 the benchmarks on one muskin 120 just tested by me had 500mbs and 230mbs read writes i would test the samsung but its a brick,everybody touts the samsungs as the best well they are very good at what they do but no one can tell you what to do if you need to re use them to make them work in another machine 157 paperweight when 40 120gb by someone else works just as good,the rma and support is the worst of all ssd makers and least available info for the process its been 3 weeks since i called them and waiting for an email with instructions on where to return it i was using this 500 gb in my girlfriends laptop trying to save it for her because she is slow learner on computers still using vista finally got tired of hearing about it so i bought her a new one trying to salvage the ssd i tried many things to no avail it is not readable as a drive in any other computer what good is a 3 10 year warranty if you can t get it,year,2015-12-06 13:23:55,1,2015,12,6

1332,ssd data migration,more work needs to be put into the migration software that gives you more options as to what you are going to migrate and what you are not,super fast i used to have to wait for more than 3 minutes for everything to load on my desktop now desktop is fully loaded and awaiting commands within 20 seconds i was skeptical about what results to expect but i am definitely impressed it came with software to measure the speeds of this ssd and and others in your computer,my only gripe is the migration software which i hear is standard with all brands if your old c drive hdd that you want to replace is more than the capacity of the new ssd you must chose from music pictures video and other stuff to trim the size down only problem is i could not remove enough of those items to create enough space to do a successful migration so i searched the web and ended up using rufus to create a bootable o s and it worked like a charm within 10 minutes,week,2015-12-04 06:58:56,4,2015,12,4

1347,one word fast,149 99 was the black friday deal that is still a good amount of coin to spend on a hard drive i wish these would come down a little more on the price another thing i noticed is that these do not come with a sata cable or a tray to mount your drive in your desktop if you have a custom built pc that is within 5 years old you will most likely have a tray that fits these ssd drives mine luckily did i did not have to buy one i also had a few sata cables laying around that i always keep on hand but for some of you that may be a different story if you buy this drive and do not have any spare sata cables laying around be sure to add one to your order along with this drive so that when you receive your drive and open the box you are not disappointed when you do not see a sata cable and realize you cannot do the swap till you get a cable for 149 99 sale price it should come with a sata cable that was a sale price retail is over 200 come on samsung at least put a cable in the box it s a 1 part i like samsung products but thought that was a little cheap on their end to not include one,the samsung data transfer software was pretty nice it allows you to clone your main drive to the ssd i didn t use that method though to clone my main disk i used another type of software to clone the primary partition to the ssd this was my first ssd i just never took the plunge because of their high prices you get what you pay for sure i could ve bought a 40 ssd but how long would ve that lasted me i read a lot of great reviews about the samsung pro evo model ssd s and saw the deal for black friday i couldn t refuse i did some research and compared some other brand name ssd s vs this samsung 850 evo this by far was one of the better ones on the market the read write and sequential write speeds surpassed 90 of the ssd s that are on the market my computer used to take about 1 minute to boot up from start now it takes 14 seconds to get to the main desktop it s insane on how fast everything is,none that i can see,week,2015-12-03 01:23:41,5,2015,12,3
1348,impressive upgrade even for a previous 830 owner,buy it if you can afford it and have the board for it go samsung 950 m 2,as stated in my review title i m a previous long time owner of the samsung 830 128gb which i loved however when i saw a sale for this item i couldn t pass up a newer version with more space i did a clean install with this drive for windows 7 and had absolutely no issues on my either my test board z170 or old z68 rig besides the sale being the reason for getting this when viewing the comparison on ssd userbenchmark com i couldn t help but get excited at a potential 51 increase over the samsung 830 my previous 830 128gb in bench test showed the following sequential testread 509 mb swrite 264 mb smixed 263 mb srandom 4k test4k read 23 1 mb s4k write 61 9 mb s4k mixed 19 6 mb sdeep queue 4k testdq read 243 mb sdq write 77 8 mb sdq mixed 56 7 mb sthe new samsung 850 evo showed the following in bench tests sequential testread 518 mb s 1 76 increase write 431 mb s 63 25 increase mixed 389 mb s 47 90 increase random 4k test4k read 42 2 mb s 82 68 increase 4k write 90 2 mb s 45 71 increase 4k mixed 41 2 mb s 110 20 increase deep queue 4k testdq read 267 mb s 9 87 increase dq write 189 mb s 142 93 increase dq mixed 110 mb s 94 increase those increases speak for themselves on justifying the upgrade while my personal comparison above is across two different size drives 850 250gb vs 830 128gb i m not overly concerned with the amount of skew that offers in the results this is evident when looking at other people s benches of 120gb 850 evos vs 128gb 830s,there are none my samsung 830 lasted for 3 years i expect great things from this ssd as well,year,2015-12-02 08:49:07,4,2015,12,2
1349,solid,high recommend this drive especially if you re coming from an hdd or an older ssd,very fast drive even by ssd standards this drive replaced a 4 year old ocz agility 3 drive that was working fine but had been getting progressively slower over the last 6 months or so benchmarked the ocz drive and this drive the samsung posted nearly 2 5x seq read and 3x seq write and 4 5x random read write this was done with samsung s rapid mode turned off on the rapid mode feature though the benchmarks with it turned on are incredible i honestly did not notice any appreciable real world difference to leave this turned on so i turned it back off this is more due to how fast the drive is by default not a knock on the rapid mode feature can t forget that sweet samsung 5 year warranty hope i never have to use it but the peace of mind is nice major props to samsung for offering this to their users,none so far,week,2015-12-01 19:25:59,5,2015,12,1

1352,great value,i have no idea about long term reliability between intel and samsung ssds time will tell if this drive performs equal to or better than my 730s than it s more than a bargain at this price until proven otherwise i will stick with the evo ssds,i was a loyal intel 730 series ssd fan for over 2 years i never even considered another brand even when i found tech stats that prove it s not the fastest so this black friday i switched to the samsung evo primarily because of pricing so far it fired up quickly when booting for the first time into bios on my new rig i look forward to testing it vs my other rigs with intel ssds samsung did a good job on this one i highly recommend this for your boot or data drives,none so far it s humming along,year,2015-12-01 12:59:38,5,2015,12,1

1356,unfortunately it failed after a week,i don t have any prior experience with samsung but hopefully this is just a fluke i will update my review if i can return this and get a replacement,good price for a 500tb ssd,i formatted the hard drive and installed os x yosemite onto it and then installed it into my old 2011 macbook pro it worked for about a week but then one day as i was opening photoshop the computer died and rebooted into a gray screen of death i tried several different things to get it working but it wouldn t boot fully so i formatted the drive again and installed os x yosemite again it worked for a few minutes and then it started rebooting whenever i tried to open an app finally it died completely again it s definitely the hard drive because if i put the old hard drive back into the computer everything works fine again,year,2015-11-30 17:01:50,1,2015,11,30

1367,pleased overall,this drive was purchased to make a new cheapy hp laptop with only 4 gigs of ram run faster and run faster it did i may not bump the memory to 8 gigs as it ll just be too fast grin but note that samsung s data migration software will not copy your recovery partition so you ll have to make other arrangements in order to be able to reload windows from scratch in the future and if your upgrading from w7 to w10 as i did you ll need to do the upgrade before migration because w10 balked at the upgrade when it saw the evo didn t contain the recovery partition went back and did the upgrade to w10 on the spinning drive which retained the recovery partition and then migrated everything to the evo and it all worked but only the boot partition migrates,replaced spinning drive in new laptop and install went pretty much flawlessly see other thoughts samsung software cd included migration tool and magician but downloading same from samsung s website yielded newer versions,prices on this particular model jump around daily sometimes as much as 20 so watch for awhile or you ll pay too much,month,2015-11-27 19:58:10,5,2015,11,27

1401,good ssd,all i need was a fast and reliable ssd for a good price it does the job perfectly,samsung is a well known company delivering a great product i do not have any complaints at the moment i don t really like extensively testing all my products with benchmarks so i can t offer any technical information in that respect the price is good and the performance is what i was expecting if i have any issues in the future i ll be sure to re review the product,the only con i can report is that i didn t purchase the larger ssd but that has nothing to with the product itself i didn t run many benchmarks to compare this with other products like i said earlier i just needed something to get the job done and this does it,month,2015-11-17 08:04:25,5,2015,11,17
1402,solid drive,,upgraded a mid 2012 macbook pro to the samsung evo 1tb ssd wow night and day difference this thing absolutely rips on the old hd had a lot of pinwheels and things took forever to load even with a completely fresh install get the occasional pinwheel but suspect that s related to osx and or the processor and not seeking can t comment on the difference among ssds but samsung seems to get consistently high ratings and reviews the biggest difference between the evo and pro for me is the warranty evo has a 5 year warranty pro has a 10 year they also have different controllers but suspect the marginal speed difference there is not something i ll pick up on browsing the internet or word processing,price i have no clue wait for this to go on sale and always check the newegg email promotion before checkout saved 10 on this drive,day,2015-11-17 07:00:54,5,2015,11,17
1403,decent,samsung 830 and 850evo were in the same price bracket however the quality of the drives are worlds apart it appears that samsung has packaged a generic drive in their evo series which remains the same price as the previous better samsung drives then they packaged their regular drive into the pro series and charge you double for what you used to get from them for much cheaper over 3 years samsung quality has stayed the same but the price has drastically gone up for said quality the drives are either too expensive or poorly built,good storage capacity for the price tag which is normally discounted samsung 5 year warranty samsung magician is useful to those new to ssd s or for those that don t want to do the research on how to tweak your os for a ssd,i purchased a samsung 830 back in 2012 and it was amazingly fast 3 years later i upgraded to the 850 only to get a slower drive one would think after 3 years samsung would make their drives to be faster not just larger no 3 5 adapter not many come with that so no biggie,year,2015-11-16 09:27:15,3,2015,11,16

1449,samsung ssds rock,if your motherboard does not have any sata iii ports the performance increase provided by the ssd will not be as great but your computer will still be considerably faster than your old hard drive if you plan on migrating your current operating system to an ssd you will need a usb 3 dongle that includes a sata connection for the drive these are available from newegg but are not included with the drive i have utilized casper software to migrate the operating system from a hard drive to an ssd i have also loaded a clean version of windows 7 to an ssd both times the process was painless and the ssd sure does take a lot less time to load all of the post sp1 windows 7 updates i haven t tried one of these drives in a laptop but the performance increase should be significant since there are a lot of laptops out there utilizing 5400 rpm hard drives in addition the battery should last longer since the ssd uses less electricity than a spinning platter hard drive,it took me a long time to make the move to an ssd when prices finally came down i bought a samsung 840 evo and would never consider going back that 840 evo is still working perfectly in my main computer i recently purchased two 850 evo s one for my htpc the other for my daughter s business computer with an ssd bootup speed decreases programs open faster and your general computing experience improves i use the maximum reliability setting in the samsung magician software since i favor longevity over the slight speed boost you may get from maximum performance i don t use the rapid mode since the reviews on it are mixed i do utilize a ramdisk for my ie cache to reduce writes to the ssd,none,year,2015-11-04 12:15:25,5,2015,11,4
1450,review update,this is my second review of this product i am revising my review to a more favorable rating because samsung did resolve the software technical problems associated with win 10 and post ver 48 magician4 on their web site,1 speed 2 bang for the buck 3 quality physical design and manufacturing 4 web site does post software and firmware updates 5 many highly favorable reviews by independent sources 6 product bundled with monitoring and control software,1 minimal installation literature suggestions 2 corporate bunker mentality no real product issues acknowledged,year,2015-11-04 07:23:37,4,2015,11,4
1451,fast and responsive,i ve been spoiled by ssd ever since i started using it on my win7 desktop it s been so responsive and fast to use boot time is short and loading large games have been quick with the 850 evo i dropped this into a laptop with a core i3 cpu in it not only does the laptop boot insanely fast but everything is now responsive and snappy i used to put the laptop into hibernation when it was using the hard drive it s now fast enough that i don t need hibernation any more,fast responsive and small makes a great laptop replacement drive or as an upgrade,very minimal packaging it simply comes with the drive and that s it if your case does not have mountings for a 2 5 drive you should grab a mounting adapter prior to purchasing,year,2015-11-04 02:13:51,5,2015,11,4
1452,usual ssd fastness,hooking the drive up as a slave in this system i have now 4 total hard drives a ssd boot drive 120gb and two secondary media drives at 640gb each of the older rotational variety installed the new evo booted up and went to look for it doesnt have a drive letter hmm ok shows up in device manager just fine drivers are already the newest it has the newest firmware on it too it has been so long since i have added a new drive that i forgot its not ready to go right out of the box so once its installed speaking purely as a slave drive windows 10 though it should be the same for 8 as well right click the windows start menu and select disk management find the new drive if the window doesnt automatically popup to intialize the drive use the mbr master boot record option also use the simple volume setting as well hit ok and once thats done format using ntfs drive should be all happy and ready to go with its new drive letter,it is an ssd so its well fast i have not had a chance to benchmark it against my other drive thats already installed i will update the review with numbers versus an older design drive for comparisons sake later,minor nitpick which may just be me forgetting something the quick setup instructions show a usb dongle to clone the drive from your current im assuming drive you are replacing well it doesnt include one so this would baffle some people i think there are also no instructions for just installing it as a secondary drive,week,2015-11-03 10:03:59,4,2015,11,3
1453,great replicator software,,samsung replicator software was able to clone my existing operating system disk to the new samsung 850 it was able to do this from within windows 7 it was really nice to be able to clone my old disk to the samsung 850 without having to run some stupid usb boot stick or other command line utility,the following complaint has nothing to do with samsung i have an old gigabyte motherboard with marvell hard drive controller marvell controllers are junk i will never see the full performance capability of this samsung 850 due to my marvell sata iii 6gb s controller marvell 9128,day,2015-11-02 23:27:58,5,2015,11,2

1459,just a great job,how can you go wrong with this drive the price is great the thing will last even much longer than they quote there have been tests and magician software is even helpful rapid is a cool concept if you ve got some ram to spare basically turns this single ssd in to an ssd raid 0 feel by using ram as cache just like raid cards do if you re thinking about the pro vs this model the only differences are the pro has a 3 core controller vs this model s 2 core the pro is provisioned to the full capacity 512 vs 500 and the pro has the longer warranty will you feel any difference with the pro in a home rig no in a high end workstation where this drive is going to take a beating for long periods of time autocad and other specific use cases the pro could be worth it as it will yield lower latency likely works better in raid arrays though you should be looking at the sm951 these days and is quoted to last longer,fast its samsung so innovation is never lacking 3d vertical nand software,na,year,2015-11-01 06:27:24,5,2015,11,1

1495,not installed yet,waiting for separately purchased mounting bracket to show up so that i can install this ssd in my desktop i know that the product description does not mention a mounting bracket but samsung s website does and so do the installation instructions so i guess samsung can not splurge for a 10 cent piece of metal and forces the consumer to go spend 5 to buy it separately since when is this an acceptable practice,drive included,mounting bracket not included,week,2015-10-15 16:08:02,2,2015,10,15

1505,awesome drive poor software,overall i am extremely happy with this drive samsung needs to fix the migration software but if you can successfully migrate your data you will be pleased with the performance,this drive substantially improved the performance of my laptop i installed this drive in a intel i7 toshiba s55 b5268 with 12gb of ram running windows 8 1 i was having problems with the disk utilization maxing out at 100 and sluggish performance i installed this drive migrated from my hdd more on this latter and am amazed at how much better my laptop runs after i optimized the drive for my system using the samsung software my wake up time is a few seconds and my boot time was reduced by over 2 minutes,the migration software that comes with this product is poor it does the job but like many other reviews my migration stalled for hours at the 100 mark the system kept saying not responding on the software however i noticed that every minute or so it would advance the clock on the migration software by a few seconds this indicated that it constantly switching from not responding to running most of the time not responding i decided to let it go and 4 hours later it finished the migration total time to migrate around 550gb was around 10 12 hours also the kit does not come with a spacer to install this 7 millimeter drive in 9 5 millimeter bays suppose this could be a user responsibility but my last ssd came with one,week,2015-10-12 20:08:27,5,2015,10,12

1524,well worth the money,i am currently using a sata ii mobo so this drive is only half as fast as it could be on a sata iii drive and i can only imagine at this point what that would be like my old hard drive is almost full and about 4 5 years old i was playing world of warcraft and was getting fed up with objects people phasing into my view distance most people think this is lag but it is actually the objects loading off your hard drive slowly after the your pc knows thye object should be there anyways this drive completely fixed that phasing issue and makes the game feel like i am playing on a brand new pc i am blown away at the performance change this made to the game i started warcraft on my pc and my wife s pc at the same time i was in the game with all objects loaded and she had not even started the load bar yet this was my first experience with a ssd and more of a personal experiment to see if they are worth the money i can assure you the pc i am building will have nothing but ssd s i cannot go back i will not go back,super easy install very fast loading times my next building will have a 1tb samsung ssd for sure,none,week,2015-10-07 12:45:25,5,2015,10,7

1530,one of the best on the market,while i know it s a ridiculously fast and very reliable drive i really didn t notice much improvement with my computer overall between loading windows and games maybe it saves me a few seconds here and there but it s no lightning speed like most ppl hype ssds to be not even close it s not the drive s fault or whether or not i set the drive up properly cuz i did i followed all the procedures to maximize the performances and the bench tests confirm it s crazy speeds it s likely just the rest of the computer holding it back when loading stuff i m just glad i waited this long to officially own my first ssd when the prices finally became reasonable pc asus m4a89gtd pro amd x4 965 4ghz with aftermarket cooler 4x2gb ddr3 ram 1600mhz 9 9 9 24 gtx 660 s2 3gb win7,based on my extensive research it s one of the best drives on the market best one being the pro version of this drive and it s surprisingly cheaper than some of the other drives too probably because of them being high in demand,none,month,2015-10-05 02:37:29,5,2015,10,5

1535,ssd died really,for anybody thinking of getting an ssd do it just make sure you create a crash plan these things are not as reliable as they claim to be as for repairing them good luck we found that the main controller had failed it wasn t a solder issue but the chip it s self just dead we had to buy another replace the chip then spend hours scouring the drive for information unfortunately this chip resets the drives cache switches so it deleted everything in short if this drive fails don t waste money on expensive recovery options unless it is a simple solder issue chances are very high that the information will be un recoverable,i have ordered 50 of these in the last year all work very well they are fast and breathe new life into any computer with sata,one of the computers i built in the last year died suddenly with no warning at all of impending doom this was 7 months after it entered service there was a raid array for file backups but the user decided to turn off backup and restore because samsung drives are rated for 1 million plus hours well we got less than 30k hours out of it here is my big problem obviously i build computers and work on lots of them so when a drive with valuable data crashes we want to know why and see if it is repairable by deciding to look at why this drive has crashed we voided the warranty samsung wont repair the faulty drive so what am i supposed to do we have valuable data on that drive why do i have to take the hit for this failure because samsung cant stand behind their product when it fails,year,2015-09-30 14:15:27,1,2015,9,30

1541,850 evo,i would recommend if you are looking to upgrade your hd,very fast it completely changed my experience of computing i still used an old 500 gb 7 000 rpm with windows 7 load time of windows and key programs is incredible,after about 6 months the drive randomly started freezing intermittently on startup of windows it seems like i have to reinstall windows 7 again or there is an issue with the drive i sure hope not because samsung is a quality company imo,year,2015-09-28 14:40:50,4,2015,9,28
1542,excellent,i did a clean install of win10 home on this ssd aside from some crucial programs my favorite games are also installed i have win10 set to automatic login so its just a matter of seconds from turning on my rig to getting to my desktop with all my startup programs already loaded i have zero regrets on this ssd perhaps i should have gotten the 500gb instead of the 250gb but it was reasonably priced when i bought it i highly recommend it i m considering getting another and running raid 0,extremely fast this is my first ssd i ve always used mechanical drives so the difference at first impression was tremendous i set all my programs such as steam origin amd gaming evolved battlenet teamspeak on top of my other startup programs and to put it simply they are all ready as soon as you log into windows also some games such as cs go battlefield 4 for example do load faster when installed on the ssd,it s a bare drive i had extra screws and all purpose brackets for my tower to accommodate the ssd but you should probably buy extra screws if you don t have as this hard drive comes with no other accessories aside from the ssd there is also no sata to usb adapter for the data migration software so if you were planning on doing that be sure to pick up a cable with your order,month,2015-09-28 12:14:51,5,2015,9,28

1550,great drive,just a tech note for general information currently there are very few cloning or migration tools that are compatible with windows 10 do a little research and you will find that technical workarounds exist i did not use the included samsung tool as i had already found a way to make ez gig cloning work with windows 10,i started buying samsung ssd about 2 years ago i have been very happy with price performance ratio it just keeps getting better and better this drive replaces a 64gb crucial drive nothing wrong with the old drive just ran out of space i used the apricorn usb3 notebook drive upgrade kit with ez gig cloning software run this cloning software from the cd or windows 10 will barf very important do not install the cloning software to a windows 10 system again run it directly from the cd and it works jim dandy tickty boo,none for me,month,2015-09-23 12:57:43,5,2015,9,23

1553,secrets to get this to work,samsung s instructions do not mention having to change the boot options f12 on dell when using uefi and a secure boot bios plus the drive installs without all of its high speed features enabled you have to manually enable them using the samsung magician sw the included samsung data migration sw did move my win 8 1 hd to the ssd i purchased the 500 mb samsung 850 evo instead of the 1tb drive to update a laptop and i assume this drive will use slightly less power as there is 1 2 of the ram on board the reviews i checked did not show a difference in standby power between evo and pro models i hope that s true for use on my laptop,installed this drive in a dell inspiron 15 7548 laptop formats to 464 gb used samsung data migration sw to copy my existing hd with win 8 1 then you have to use samsung magician sw to enable high speed features including a ram disk buffer note the ram disk buffer uses part of your system memory,the first time you boot this drive dell s bios give us a no bootable device found error you must use f12 boot options to tell the system to boot from the ssd for the first time bios settings f2 do not show an option to boot from the ssd worked with dell chat session and verified we can t change boot options using the bios they recommended booting from a recovery usb stick and reloading win 8 1 when you insert the usb stick to boot you have to hit boot options f12 and then there is a choice to boot from the ssd so we didn t need a recovery disk to reload the os,month,2015-09-23 06:15:17,4,2015,9,23
1554,installation sw doesn t work with windows 10,if you do the research you will find there are many comments out there from folks who chose this unit primarily because it is the only ssd that comes with installation software but they could not use this software under windows 10 also note that most of the doa complaints probably stem from the fact that the samsung software does not even recognize the drive under windows 10,it runs great once you get it installed,the ad for this unit claims one stop install navigator softwarein three simple steps the samsung one stop install navigator software easily allows you to migrate all the data and applications from your existing drive to the 850 evo the included samsung magician software also allows you to setup optimize and manage your system for peak ssd performance it should have a note that says samsung navigator and samsung magician do not work with windows 10,month,2015-09-23 03:43:57,1,2015,9,23

1556,need to know for an osx install,there are a few ways to accomplish the install but essentially you are going to find a way to clone your existing hdd to the ssd either through osx or a 3rd party app then remove your hdd and replace with the ssd and after a boot with the new ssd if you didn t screw up the clone 4 hours of copying you need to enable trim once again either through osx or a 3rd party app,fast reliable great price perfect upgrade for pre ssd macbook pro s,zero support from apple or samsung you are on your own for the complete install completely opposite a pc3rd party apps at cost are almost essential for a better user experience and installsamsung included disk is worthless to osx the entire disk is for pc exe s only for migration and enhancement software,day,2015-09-22 13:50:16,5,2015,9,22

1560,not supported by amd onboard raid,i plan on buying a hardware raid card to move my raid 1 array off of the onboard sata ports so i can change them to ahci i did to one test run with raid off and ahci on and the ssd performed very fast i didn t do any tests with numbers or whatever but i did use the computer how i normally would and noticed a dramatic increase in performance,faststores data,my amd motherboard supports hardware raid but the onboard raid controller doesn t support this ssd it won t even work if i make the ssd a single disk which was my plan i have an existing raid 1 array and that s the only reason i even have raid on so now my new ssd and my current os ssd are both plugged into non raid sata ports but i can only make them ide emulated so they re running slower than they could not really samsung s fault more the fault of amd and their basic raid controller just watch out for that,week,2015-09-21 03:33:50,4,2015,9,21
1561,best upgrade of my five and a half year old build,whether you re using a computer that old like the one that i have from 2010 or building a new skylake system even though they re touting pcie ssd support a lot this ssd is the best choice for most people at first i was concerned that i might be using the ssd too much that i could wear it out before the five year warranty is up but since then it has dropped down to much more acceptable levels the endurance level is so high you d be writing to the ssd 80gb day every day to reach the 150tb endurance rating in five years most people like me don t write to the ssd 80gb day i used up roughly twice as much in the first day to install the os and the applications but i think that s the only time you ll be doing such a lot of writes in one day so the 850 evo should be fine for most users despite the fact we ve got faster ssds such as the 850 pro and intel s 750 at a much higher price while in my opinion doesn t accelerate as much in turning on the computer using everyday applications and turning off the computer it would only benefit in content creating applications such as adobe s creative suite of programs even when i m using bittorrent when my computer is idle the ssd doesn t write very much right now my total amount of data written to the ssd is less than the 80gb daily average my boot times for my computer though were roughly the same as without ssd or marginally better but i think it s because i have too much hard drives connected and it may be because of the older platform overall this is the upgrade i ve been waiting for way too long i ve been using the 840 evo ssd on my laptop and it changed how i used my laptop so why not my desktop computer i ve been really wanting this ssd for months despite the age of my computer and finally i am proud to be a very highly satisfied customer of the 850 evo highly recommended whether you re tired of using an hdd as an os drive and need the extra kick of responsiveness of an ssd or building your next dream computer build my system specs core i7 860 p55 16gb ddr3 ram gtx 980 3500gb of additional internal storage hdds 8500gb of additional external storage hdds,probably this is the best upgrade i ve done throughout my past five and a half years using my custom built computer core i7 860 i ve been upgrading throughout the recent years from more storage hard drives to system memory maxed out at 16gb and graphics card gtx 980 but nothing changed my computing experience than this 850 evo ssd i bought simply put this is the best ssd to choose for most people simply put this upgrade has made my computer much more responsive than what it had been without using an ssd even if the computer that i m using was from 2010 i know there are much faster ssds out there especially those pcie nvme ssds but they re not so signifcant in terms of improving speed on everyday tasks such as web browsing these drives are much more suitable for content creation personally the 850 evo has pretty much sufficient performance necessary for most people so this is the best value out there samsung magician software is a plus and so too the five year warranty most other drives in this segment have say three or even two year warranties,none so far my motherboard is from 2010 that does not have 6gb s sata ports so the performance isn t as fast as say one with such ports but that s a motherboard issue not the ssd,month,2015-09-20 23:21:23,5,2015,9,20

1566,requires intel rst,after installing samsung magician and running the performance test i was disappointed to see that i was only getting two thirds of the advertised random read write speeds after several internet searches i discovered that this was not uncommon with the samsung 850 evo and that i would have to install intel s rapid storage technology to achieve the advertised results samsung gets around this little fact by advertising up to a bit deceptive if you ask me,compact nice price per gb easy to install,required installation of updated intel rst ahci drivers to get advertised random speeds a fact samsung fails to mention in their spec lists,week,2015-09-19 08:46:51,4,2015,9,19

1591,overall satisfied,after purchasing this i then read a lot of the reviews a lot of which are negative towards the supplier and the shipping errors so i figured i would chime in ordered this on a monday got it in the mail usps on friday the estimate was slated for saturday i live on the east coast and it was shipped from the west coast they said 5 7 business days and that s what i got so honestly i cannot complain furthermore mine worked like a charm after having just built a new computer it was the last part i needed to hook up to my computer all the other pieces mobo psu etc arrived wednesday what i will say though its mostly food for thought is that is does come in a small bubble padded yellow envelope and that it does not come with any sata cables i didn t mind the packaging as it was not damaged or tarnished in any way and i did not need a sata cable because several came with my new psu,just bigger than a credit card slim extremely fast pc boots up in no more than ten seconds,none so far,week,2015-09-07 20:24:19,5,2015,9,7
1592,purchased to clean install windows ten,price was very reasonable shipping was extremely fast buy a sata cable if you know you ll need another one,bought this drive to increase speed when booting windows and running programs and it did just that first i upgraded my hdd to windows 10 using the free upgrade option from my oem pre installed windows 7than downloaded the windows 10 media creation tool from microsoft and burned the proper iso removed the hdd and replaced with new evo ssd booted from the windows 10 cd i made and it installed like a charm requiring no license keys because the upgrade license links to your motherboard and cpu after the fresh install of windows 10 on the ssd it takes longer to get through my 5 second posted delay than it does to start windows turning on the computer for the first time literally takes about 7 seconds minus the 5 second delay i put on myself great drive so far,doesnt come new sata cable,month,2015-09-07 11:39:44,4,2015,9,7

1598,second time seems to be the charm,i have prior experience with an 840 evo drive in one of my htpc s this unit was running windows 8 1 when i installed the drive and samsung s software performed like a champ still plays nice now that i have upgraded to windows 10,very reasonably priced fast,first one was doa second one works but not without significant issues with samsung s included software the samsung migration utility does not recognize the drive on any of my four windows 10 systems two notebooks running home and two htpc s running premium further these drives don t seem to play well with all usb caddys the first one i used was a bytecc usb3 caddy windows 10 reported that the drive failed to initialize on all four computers an old toshiba usb2 worked and i was able to use acronis true image to clone my drive i didn t bother with the samsung magician software i ll wait until a version that plays nice with windows 10 comes along,day,2015-09-04 15:30:31,4,2015,9,4
1599,not recommended,the serious performance slowdown issue of the 840 nonpro 840 evo and possibly 850 evo should really be handled with a recall program they tried to fix it with firmware but it doesn t work i wouldn t be surprised to see this issue turn into a class action,specs on paper are good especially the 4k random read single queue which is essential for fast desktop performance 5 years warranty also sound good,i bought this 850 evo to replace an aging 840 evo ssd which had horrible drops in performance despite the newest firmware hdtune read rate on the old 840 was very uneven and maybe as lows as 10 of what it should be so the new 850 evo should be much better right yes it was better but not as good as other new ssds i tested the 850 evo drive with both as ssd and hdtune once after writing it half full of data and once after a secure erase after i had copied over 250gb of data via disk imaging the performance of the 850 evo in hdtune was uneven showing a significant drop maybe 50 in read rate when reading the logical blocks with freshly written data and full speed only on the empty portions of the hdd next i did a secure erase and tested again this time the read rate was good across the entire all empty disk note however when i tested a bx100 and some other recent ssds they were able to maintain the same full performance read speed in hdtune regardless of whether they were full of data or freshly secure erased basically the evo will slow down once you write actual data to it this was a huge problem for the 840 evo and while the issue has been improved with the 850 evo the slowdown issue is still not completely gone and this is fresh out of the box basically i don t trust any tlc drives anymore and i am returning my 850 evo to newegg after this find what make matters worse is samsung s really bad rma process which you need to utilize once you are out of exchange privileges with newegg i am trying to have my 840 evo exchanged through samsung but rma for samsung ssds goes through a 3rd party company samsung s own rma website they call it xra is broken when you hit the submit button instead you need to find the 3rd party company totalts com which is difficult to locate to begin with and which hasn t responded in a week newegg is very helpful with its support but samsung s 5 year warranty is useless if you can t actually reach anyone to exercise it so now i don t trust samsung s ssd tlc memory in general and samsung s rma process in particular buyer beware,week,2015-09-04 13:29:07,2,2015,9,4

1601,excellence in the evo,nothing comes with it but documentation software cd and drive expected but if you buy on make sure you get a sata3 cable too 50 here on newegg not a big deal,wanted to get a new ssd for my more often played games currently have an ocz vertex 3 for my os a 5200 rpm storage drive and now this guy all i can say is the drive performs as expected and i expected a lot i don t have the numbers but the load times in the few titles i tested mgs pp and battlefield 4 specifically have increased astronomically i don t have numbers in front of me but a guesstimate on loading a bf4 map from the storage drive probably jumped by 1 2 minutes the magician software is nice too compared to the essentially non existent ocz software samsung is light years ahead of the curve i ve read all the negative reviews and aside from a couple doas early failure and compatibility issues the consensus is this is a great upgrade new build drive,none as of yet,week,2015-09-04 10:04:11,5,2015,9,4
1602,this was a major upgrade in performance,the complaint in my case is nothing compared to the incredible performance and stability of the equipment i cannot recommend it more highly,i am a real estate photographer and my business depends upon producing dozens of very high resolution images a day i regularly process over 500 38mp raw files through adobe lightroom and an application enfuse in a day to produce 60 to 90 production marketing images for my clients this is after shooting all day i process the images at night before i got my evo 850 i was regularly working until 1am getting those files ready to give to my clients first thing in the morning now i am in bed most nights after fallon s monologue this drive enabled me to step up to the next level in production i can shoot more homes in a day and not be worried about not getting any sleep before i have to get up and do it all over again in the three weeks since i installed it i have made easily 25 more than i did in the previous month i have knocked off that much time from my workflow i m going to get another for my desktop computer when i have time to migrate to it hopefully the price will drop even more by then,the software that came with this drive is totally worthless i found a free cloning software that took care of my transfer of my hard disk it was slow but it got the job done when the samsung software just failed acronis failed too for that matter and after researching the problem i found that neither application supports uefi hard disks,month,2015-09-04 04:51:07,5,2015,9,4
1603,good drive not so good software,great drives looks like samsung has not updated their software in over a year easy to install drives and moving from a hdd to ssd is amazing son s pc only upgrading small 64gb to 250gb,the drive itself is very good easy to install fast and has plenty of capacity,the data migration software is awful i got 2 drives a 1 tb for my pc and a 250gb for my son s tried the included samsung software no luck it continually reported errors or said it completed the clone but the drive was still raw i had the same problem with my pc the next day the samsung software would simply not work ended up using a freeware software called aomei backupper on both pc s worked flawlessly and had the new drives up and running in no time,week,2015-09-03 21:09:16,3,2015,9,3

1606,review update,simple problem solved by simple solution read the reviews for most answers samsung software would not work would not clone as one reviewer noted it didn t work using usb 3 0 port for some reason system did not possess a usb 2 0 port introduced a usb 2 0 hub and it worked perfectly the reason is unclear but it should be annotated somewhere would solved a lot of anxiety almost had to return my first item in 10 years should read all reviews starting with the 1 and 2 eggers,increased speed great price works like a charm so far,after initial confusion no real cons,week,2015-09-02 09:20:00,4,2015,9,2

1608,amazing boot times,using as the windows 10 boot drive in a new system with absolutely everything else i can redirect being installed to a standard hard drive,first time owning an ssd running with windows 10 cold boot only takes about 10 12 seconds on average and selecting restart to being ready to log in again is about 8 seconds not sure if it is all due to the ssd something in the motherboard hardware bios windows 10 or any combination of the bunch but very impressive to me none the less,none so far,month,2015-09-01 17:18:07,5,2015,9,1

1612,,never used ssd before so i m not going to even review if one is better then another ssd in itself is a good choice so which ever brand you might buy you should be pretty pleased with the fast boot up times alone the main reason i chose this particular samsung was from the reviews and eggs it got,boots windows in seconds feels like milliseconds compared to before i got this a definite must have item running it with a 1tb sata 6 0gb and finding no problems with loading times and what not is a definite upgrade to my new system,this was bare bones drive and did not come with a sata to usb cable so i found myself re installing a fresh copy of windows which was okay because i just bought the entire system new and decided not to clone windows from my old sata drive so really this wasn t a con but i felt the need to write something in this space,month,2015-08-31 11:07:12,4,2015,8,31
1613,good drive,this is my 2nd samsung 850 ssd 1 as boot drive for desktop other is main drive for laptop both work great and will be my ssd choice for the future if any is needed,great drive using as boot drive with windows 10 startup is around 34 secs on average from power up to fully ready to go,not issue with drive but i had an issue using samsung data migration software after completed swapped in this drive and received boot errors eventually settled on clean os install,month,2015-08-31 10:55:30,5,2015,8,31

1618,great drive no windows 10 support,i m pretty amazed samsung hasn t updated their own software for windows 10 this will give their company a bad reputation for not supporting their own software i purchased the 850 evo 500 gb due to the fact that i was amazed and happy with my 256 gb 840 evo didn t realize the software would not be updated nor supported in windows 10 a bit let down by samsung to be honest still a nice ssd for the price,great price when on sale gb per dollar well respected namebrand in the ssd market proven performance and longevity,included software has no windows 10 support rapid mode is only supported with 500gb evo pro models and 840 models most buyers purchase the samsung s ssd for the software options rapid mode,month,2015-08-30 09:15:39,3,2015,8,30
1619,do not buy this,i only wrote this review because depend on the reviews by other users when i build computers and buy parts,nothing did not work right out of the box but it gets worse i let newegg send me another one and that one did not work either,did not work right out of the box i let newegg send me another one and that one did not work either i am so done buying anything from samsung,day,2015-08-30 09:13:53,1,2015,8,30

1622,works as expected,memory was listed as being shipped with the ssd however there appears to have been a snafu in shipment was a bit worried however once i had dialogue with newegg customer support the issue was resolved just have to wait a bit longer for the part crazy stuff happens but my faith in the quality of support from newegg is essentially restored,purchased to upgrade early 2006 2ghz core 2 duo imac which was gifted to me for kids schoolroom works great as expected awaiting ram to complete the upgrade see other thoughts,none,week,2015-08-29 20:55:11,5,2015,8,29
1623,great drive instructions need work,i ended up using acronis backup and cloning the original drives to an external usb hdd then restoring the image to the new ssd once replaced the drives worked as expected with no issues and perform beautify,this is a top tier consumer drive i purchased 2 of these to replace laptop hard drives for family members one used sata3 on an amd a8 laptop and after performing the read write test with the samsung magician software the results matched the advertised read write speeds the other laptop was sata2 and performed as expected i do not have the exact numbers the magician software is among the better software provided by ssd manufactures with all of the normal tools you would need to maintain and monitor your drive s health and performance,i had attempted to use the samsung migration software using and external usb3 drive dock the software never recognized the external drive and after some research online you need to ensure you have a basic usb to sata adapter with no additional features like hot swap it will not recognize the drive the instructions that came with the device are also very poor it s just pictures with really no instructions at all this could be greatly improved or not even included and just a reference to online documentation,month,2015-08-29 19:19:56,4,2015,8,29
1624,beware free shipping in envelope,so worth paid shipping if they put the thing in a box with crush protection,excellent hard drive speed and quality,chose free shipping but ssd was mailed in a very slightly padded envelope from california to boston box containing ssd had some compression indentations even though it is solid state possible putting crushing pressure on the box and ssd through a thin envelope raises the possibility of damage complained to newegg on some type of shipping complaint,month,2015-08-29 13:59:39,4,2015,8,29

1626,great ss drive for pcs and laptops,notes to future buyers the 2 5 drive fits pcs and most laptops does not come with any wires do use the samsung magician software rapid mode is awesome if you do use rapid mode i recommend minimum 16gb ram regardless of what it says it allocates ram to do its magic rapid mode will only work with one drive make sure you have ahci enabled not ide or raid for best performance the setting is usually in bios if you have a somewhat new mb or laptop with no option it may be enabled by default make sure you plug it in the sata iii port in you pc if you have multiple some boards have a combo of sata ii and sata iii if you use any data migration to transfer windows ensure you have recovery repair media or the windows dvd itself it may need to repair the boot up process,i have 2 of these so far one of the best ssds i ve had no issues with installation,none yet,month,2015-08-29 00:33:28,5,2015,8,29
1627,wonderful device,with the high quality and low prices of ssd s and their blazing fast performance in so many aspects of what a pc needs to do i will never buy another hdd again once the proces drop even more the so so fast 1t hdd i have will get shelved as well even fast hdd s are bottle necks in so many aspects and you dont even know it until you see what freaky fast ssd read writes can do for your o s,was thinking about building new pc for gaming but was on the fence about spending 1200 when my hp envy 17 j044ca seemed to be getting me decent fps in mmo s like gw2 so at the advice of a friend i spend some money on an ssd once i finally got this thing running i was stunned at the speed my laptop booted after a clean install the boot time is literally 6 seconds everything is so quick now as well programs open in the blink of an eye even my internet browsing is lightening fast now i guess because the cache is loaded so insanely fast now it just sped up the whole machine more than i thought it would breathed new life into my laptop for a few more years i suspect no need to spend more money at this time on another system,for some reason samsung has been unable to fix a bug in their included software when i plug the ssd into the usb with the adapter i spent 20 on the computer sees it i can put files on it and remove them etc but samsung s very own cloning software wont see the ssd drive i read about this bug online so thanks to this i was unable to clone my hdd and had to find a usb key download windows 10 image create a bootable usb mess with my bios and install windows onto the ssd after putting it where the hdd was now i have to hunt for and download so many drivers and set everything up again for this you suck samsung how hard of a bug can that be to fix i m a developer it aint hard no excuse for that a month into 10 s release i love your ssd but you lost an egg because of your annoying bug that caused me a nightmare part of the reason i went with samsung was because i read so many reviews raving about the cloning software and i got effed on that part,week,2015-08-28 19:54:32,4,2015,8,28

1630,speed value and reliability,with this drive dropping in price i can only imagine the 1 tb version doing so as well in the coming year or two,imo the best ssd you can buy as an everyday consumer 5 year warranty,500 gb may not be enough if you re trying to put your entire steam library on your desktop and you may need more than one if you re a professional working with large video or photo files,year,2015-08-28 06:18:03,5,2015,8,28

1640,830 850,with multiple ssds it seems motherboards don t always know which drive to boot from in a mechanical drive array the boards searched for one with a bootable operating system in the case of multiple ssds i had to specify which to boot from otherwise the boards would boot from whichever was installed first or prompt for you to pick,i upgrade my asus g750 laptop from an 830 to an 850 it was a noticeable speed upgrade if you sneeze and look at the clock you will miss the boot up with windows 8 1 at this point any more speed would be fractions of a second going from one ssd and one mechanical to two ssds increased the battery time by another half hour or more,none,year,2015-08-23 18:04:35,5,2015,8,23

1642,great ssd upgrade,,i bought this to upgrade my high end workstation used for 3d art rendering like maya zbrush etc it replaced my samsung 830 pro and also my hdd used for storage of content files so far i have been very pleased with the results it seems faster than the 830 pro for most all uses and large enough for use without another mechanical drive be advised it s not as fast as the intel pcie based ssd drives but those only have 1tb maximum capacity i chose capacity over the fastest available due to the fact it made my work faster regardless by replacing the hdd sites such as toms hardware and pcper have great reviews on this item in technical detail that i would recommend the warranty is greater with the 2tb 850 pro but i only need 5 years beyond that it doesn t matter for me also at this time the 2tb 850 evo has the slight edge in reviews bottom line is highly recommended,warranty 5 years vs 10 for the 2tb 850 pro still fairly expensive not as fast as pcie ssd drives,year,2015-08-22 16:22:02,5,2015,8,22

1649,i waited too long to get an ssd,i didn t have the usb to sata cable so i was unable to use the samsung disk image software that comes on the dvd with the drive i read about it ahead of time and prepared by downloading free clone software from easeus todo backup 1 put the drive in 2 boot into windows 3 use admin computer management and disk management 4 format the samsung drive ntfs default allocation and assign it a drive letter if you want to clone your boot drive os then continue on 5 right click the drive and select properties make the samsung drive active 6 use easeus todo backup or whatever you want to clone your previous boot os windows drive be sure and defrag that drive before you try to clone it as you want all the files compacted as much as possible disk cleanup also on the old drive once the samsung has been made a clone of your old boot drive then 7 reboot and go into your bios select the samsung ssd as the primary boot device in bios save bios and restart 8 assign your old boot drive a new drive letter not c 9 re assign the samsung drive with the os on it a new drive letter c 10 you can now format the old boot drive or keep the files on it intact in case you want to make sure the ssd works for awhile,so fast small and lightweight low no heat easy to installi held off until now to get my first ssd i was a wd 10k raptor loyalist until today spinning disks are outdated the drive is smaller than my windows phone when ups delivered it the package was so small i thought can there really be a drive in there there was and it rocks if you don t have the expansion slot for the drive it easily can mount with only 2 screws onto the side of any of the standard drive bays the thing weights a few ounces so 2 screws will be more than enough to hold it in place,no sata 6gb cable but i had several extras laying around in my motherboard box from asus no mounting kit but that wasn t an issue really due to it being mountable with 2 screws on 1 side,day,2015-08-17 19:50:31,5,2015,8,17

1687,great ssd,make sure you have a sata cable and sata port on your mobo that is rated at 6gigabits rather than 1 5 or 3 to get the full effect,gta5 has less pop in and slightly better frame rates than my old hdd would allow plus my os boots up in seconds,not huge but if you can get it for 90 100 it s worth it especially with the 5 year warranty,week,2015-07-31 07:49:27,5,2015,7,31
1688,fast and cheap,,this 500gb ssd was extremely cheap and came bundled with a 64gb ssd,did no come with any cables or mounting tools the instructions show that it has all of these different cables but the box only contains the drive it would be nice if they had it come with a sata cable,month,2015-07-31 05:00:33,4,2015,7,31
1689,like a charm,this drive comes with the drive a quick start guide with cartoon guides for setting the drive up on a laptop or desktrop a warranty statement in umpteen languages and a disc with samsung magician and a more in depth manual there are no mounting brackets or adapters and there is no sata cable and if you plan to clone a drive there is no usb adapter you cannot use an external encasing have these on hand if you want to install when you get your shipment or better yet order them with the drive samsung magician is totally optional on sata iii without it you ll get advertised read write speeds with magician you ll not only meet them almost consistently you can easily exceed them a previous reviewer has stated by 50 however samsung magician is finnicky software and in fact the drive itself is finnicky but more on that in a second let s go through my install process installed the drive checked bios it was all good it automatically set the drive to ide this came back later i did a clean install of my brand new free copy of windows 10 formatting my current 1tb wd green hdd and installing to the ssd the installation was complete in less than 30 minutes with me as the bottleneck it booted fine drivers installed well updates went without a hitch then my system crashed i installed samsung magician and it reported everything was okay but notified me you re using this drive in ide mode and not ahci to get the best performance we recommend ahci mode was this significant yes i tried all sorts of drive settings and optimizations in magician my system would keep crashing periodically i troubleshooted for two hours before i finally decided to switch the drive to ahci this is tangly if you installed windows on ide and change the bios to ahci windows will not want to boot it s set to load ide drivers and never even look at ahci drivers to optimize your booting your pc will not boot if you change your drive to ahci after installing windows with the drive in ide a safe mode boot after switching to ahci solves this however that was in fact the issue i left my pc on overnight to test and i came back to it humming away when i woke up the same problem can be caused by other things too they say that samsung magician and sometimes that the drive itself does not play well with amd chipsets and having an amd fx6300 i can confirm this as mentioned above on ide mode without magician on an amd mobo my pc would crash after roughly 30 minutes but in other cases ahci mode or not the drive crashes because of samsung magician it s the same problem but there are several solutions do yourself a favor and make sure you switch whatever sata port s your put this drive on to ahci before you install windows no matter your chipset intel or amd in some cases it s the difference between the drive functioning or not and in others it just straight up increases the dri,faster than any hard drive only ssd i ve seen that s faster is the same model in pro form post to windows desktop in 5 seconds or less on sata ii works well with or without samsung magician see other thoughts for more info shipped in one business day one impressive as ever,samsung magician can be a nightmare see other thoughts for more info depending on your chipset this drive might just not work for no other reason than it doesn t like your motherboard troubleshooting can take awhile due to crashes and the ssd not liking forced reboots as a boot drive very much no eggs taken off for these because any problem i have had can and has been solved with ease even the chipset issues which were due to my motherboard and not the drive anyway and samsung magician is optional,week,2015-07-31 04:51:04,5,2015,7,31

1710,ssd what more do you need to know,for some reason i was thinking this drive was the size of a 3 5 floppy drive so i had to get creative to actually mount it in my tower but since it s so light a little double sided tape did the trick it s hidden out of the way and securely mounted have this running os and other programs and another 300 gig platter drive for storage,fast but i guess that s to be expected when the only thing you ve ever used is standard platter hard drives absolutely blows away two 300 gig s i had in raid0 setup it s completely silent so that s always a plus too,none so far,week,2015-07-23 05:20:34,4,2015,7,23

1735,great upgrade,i should have done my research my motherboard only has sata ii ports which are limited to a max throughput of 300mb s also it only has pcie x1 v1 1 ports so the sata iii add on card i bought was actually limited to 200mb s throughput so i could have saved a few buck by going with a slower ssd that still would max out the capabilities of my sata ii controller i m building an i7 system soon so i ll be able to take full advantage of it then,first off a disclaimer this is my first modern ssd i ve made a few embedded systems using what we used to call disk on modules and the performance of them was alright definitely better than a hard drive but not blazing fast the also were relatively small most no bigger than a few gigs by comparison those things were a yugo this is a ferrari i m still running a core 2 quad desktop and i was afraid this wouldn t make much of a difference but was i ever wrong windows 7 boots up in just a few seconds game levels load faster basically anything that involves loading or moving lots of data on the hard drive is much much faster than it used to be,didn t include a 2 5 adapter and my old antec sonata was build before ssds were a thing,year,2015-07-14 21:02:23,5,2015,7,14
1736,as advertised,had an evo 840 before this one i ve ready a lot of reviews about the samsung evo ssd s crapping out after a while i haven t had any issues whatsoever with the 840 and i ve had it over a year no slow downs no other issues so far same story with the 850 377 for a 1tb ssd wasn t bad either,fast price,none yet,month,2015-07-13 21:15:59,5,2015,7,13
1737,minor hiccup but it s alright now,i ve heard good things about this ssd just avoid the migration software,great drive runs smoothly works like a solid state should,samsung s migration software gave me a bsod halfway through the migration progress later it turned out my machine would bsod as long as the migration software was installed uninstalled samsung and installed macrium free version macrium worked great no issues since,year,2015-07-13 17:41:49,5,2015,7,13
1738,bundled software was surprising,this drive was to replace a 2x 120gb raid 0 i had turns out copying over to one drive is harder than expected the samsung migrate software or whatever it is called on the disk did a great job of copying off the drive i was booted from none of my linux solutions had worked and this one did i was very happy to see that other than that exceptional piece it s a solid drive good speed,bundled software is actually good good packagingfast,none,year,2015-07-13 16:07:22,5,2015,7,13
1739,first impressions,this is a first impressions review of sorts i ve only been using the device for a week i certainly haven t used it long enough to test its durability i am very pleased with my purchase as of now and have always been happy with samsung products in the past i built my first gaming rig with a 200 gb samsung hard drive back in 2006 and the thing is still ticking today i ll be surprised if i don t get similar longevity from this drive,read speeds are fast not quite as fast as samsung would claim but there are other factors involved i m sure the device looks slick and clean not that anyone cares what a drive is going to look like since it will be safely hidden inside your computer but still props for making the think look nice and clean also as you would expect putting this ssd in my laptop has spared me a noticeable amount of battery life there is really not much else to say the device performs exactly how one would expect it to,i was a little disappointed when i didn t find a usb to sata adapter included with the drive the instructions imply that one is included as the graphics in the manual display such a device and a drive migration obviously cannot be completed without but one is not included there were no screws included either this is probably not a big deal because most people purchasing this device will be swapping out a hdd that already has the screws needed still the inclusion of a few cheap spare screws should be a given when you are forking out 100 on any drive again overall not a big deal but a slight disappointment,week,2015-07-13 10:15:34,5,2015,7,13

1741,awesome ssd,,this drive was super easy to install i didn t have any issues with the magic software for cloning my old hdd onto the ssd i now have this as my boot drive and my 1tb hdd as a data drive read write speeds seem on point with what the software claims pretty close to the top end of possibilities in my case boot times into windows 7 are blazing fast and we score shot up greatly compared to the mechanical drive,i kinda wish ssd drives came with mounting hardware bundled my pc didn t come with extra hardware so i had to order some parts from cooler master to get this snapped into my storm scout no reason to knock off an egg,month,2015-07-13 00:42:23,5,2015,7,13

1747,,these complaints should be addressed to samsung not to newegg however newegg could have done a better job of describing the product,fast but not impressive good pricefast delivery,poor instructions neither the add nor the box indicates the need of a usb 2 sata adapter needed i had one so i was able to install also it needs to use an existing working computer to initialize the software included only has a performance program and a migration program i did not use the migrations program since i was setting a new os the program instruct you to set the bios to achi for best performance my computer was set to ide so i had to redo the installation,week,2015-07-09 17:45:43,3,2015,7,9

1756,smoking fast drive,if you re replacing a hdd with a ssd then you must set windows directly or via magician that you have ssd and to change the appropriate settings the difference in gb from 1024 based and 1000 based sizing will say you ve got roughly 900 gig all drives do this now and most of them including samsung use that difference for sparing wear leveling reliability this is most important in ssds so i don t complain so much samsung magician also request that you over provision by letting it use up to 10 of the last partition on your drive this over provisioning is used for fast writes that it later coalesces into your partitions where it belongs this helps as a flash write requires a read insert write cycle unless it s known a flash block is empty so over provisioning uses free space known empty as skip read do write blocks so is much faster that said i m told 8 1 may do this already and i haven t found anything concise then you can use that space on that last partition so it s not lost folks mostly say don t let any partition get more than 75 full and there should be enough free space for these ssd write optimizations to work samsung magician s performance benchmark is inconsistent after a few days it started saying my sequential was 1 10th of what it should be per the web i used atto benchmark and it showed the drive was running as recommended many people say you must start from scratch on a hdd ssd but that s not true you just need to make the system changes samsung data migration will purport to make all these but it wouldn t let me migrate from an mostly empty 2tb hdd in a new laptop to the 1gb 850 evo few tools will shrink partitions not even acronis so you can do well just copying partitions over hdd ssd but you need to tweak the settings magicians optimize os will do that for you or from disk properties advanced optimize make sure all your partitions are set to optomize and i d say once per day enjoy these smoking fast drives,this drive is smoking fast and generally meets or exceeds samsung s published specs,samsung magician is inconsistent and poor about settings and properly reporting performance generally requires reboot to change it s view of the world esp partitions even if it doesn t say so,month,2015-07-06 10:51:55,5,2015,7,6

1763,so far so good this time,was not happy with the failure but i was happy with the way newegg handled the return they even paid for the return shipping i have only ever had to pay for my own return shipping one time and that was because i ordered the wrong thing as soon as the failed drive hit the warehouse a replacement was on the way and arrived 2 days later that is why i have done business with newegg since 2002,fast even when using sata 2 this was installed in a laptop that is 4 years old it is the closest thing to being brand new that a person can get without buying a new machine,had to rma the first one after only 2 weeks because it stopped booting the computer i had thought the laptop may have gave up the ghost but i popped in the old drive and it booted right up,month,2015-07-03 05:36:40,4,2015,7,3

1765,amazing difference in speed,happy camper one thought though after implementing rapid mode a good idea from my point of view i was left with not enough memory on my 8 gb 6 yr old machine for certain memory hungry applications i immediately ordered a 16 gb kit to replace what i had and my desktop now operates like a brand new machine,worked perfectly on a sata 2 machine even though it was a sata 3 ssd even still the difference in speed was immediately evident samsung s magician software helped with optimization and along with some add l manual adjustments performance was increased considerably changing sata mode to ahci made the biggest difference installing this on a sata 3 machine would probably be dramatic,the samsung software that accompanied it for cloning my c drive would not work my c drive hdd was a dynamic drive and the cloning software could not handle that however i found a third party application that did the job free no less however there were no problems with the ssd drive itself,week,2015-07-01 07:48:36,5,2015,7,1
1766,solid,i wonder if the folks who got the doa drives used the computer management disc management in windows to initialize and format the drive prior to using in my opinion if you get a bad drive you re one in a million if you get 2 start looking for other reasons why your drive is not working i installed mine in an older sony vaio laptop running only sata2 i connected the ssd with an adaptor through usb and cloned the old drive after cloning which took all night the new samsung worked flawlessly the boot time reduced from over 3 mins to 1 min probably would be better if the computer had sata3 and the laptop feels way more snappy this is my 3rd samsung ssd and 4th ssd total and all work without problems,easy installation good quality worked right out of the box comes with a cd that includes data migration software and other utilities worked with sony vaio laptop after cloning the orginal hdd i ve heard some laptops can be picky about installing a new drive so i m glad there were no issues with that,none,week,2015-07-01 05:47:21,5,2015,7,1

1785,samsung ssd 500 gb,i ordered this product 2 in fact while it was on sale and had it shipped super saver 4 7 business days on day 8 i was still waiting on the product and chatted with a newegg customer service rep i told him that the status from the shipper had not changed in 8 days and i was wondering if the product was really coming he urged me to open a claim and i did but i was really only seeking shipping status the next day i checked the shipping number on the shippers website and instead of seeing a ship date i saw a notice that shipping status was no longer available concerned i called the shipping company and they told me that the they had rec d a shipping notification but had never received a package and that the item had never shipped and the shipping number was closed now i am really concerned i called newegg and talked to a rep he could not tell me when the item would be shipped to me because it was now in the claim process i told him that i was out 356 didn t have a product and whatever internal supply chain issues that newegg and their shipping company were having should not involve me i pressed him to simply ship me the product and correct their internal fulfillment issues without involvign me although the rep was polite and quite courteous it was clear to me that he did not have the authority to address my concerns i asked to speak to the rep s manager and within a few second i had him on the phone i went over the details one more time and the manager offered me 3 alternatives i accepted the 3rd option which was repurchase the product at the sale price have it shipped overnight to me at no charge and receive a refund when the claim process is completed i have a been a long term customer of newegg and they had never let me down before so i took a chance and accepted the option even though i had doubts about locking up another 356 i am happy to report that the 2 ssd drives arrived this morning and this afternoon the claim was processed and i was refunded my first purchase price newegg took a bad situation and turned it into a very positive experience for me count me as one satisfied customer newegg has earned brand loyalty from me they clearly dropped the ball but to their credit they went the distance even when it cost them a little extra to keep a customer happy what more can a customer ask for i ll continue to send business their way they proved to me that they can be trusted to be a great place to shop online when things go badly as they sometimes do newegg makes it right thanks again newegg for a great shopping experience tony,excellent value and samsung ssd quality newegg taking a bad situation and makes something positive from it the mark of an outstanding customer service operation,no cons,week,2015-06-24 21:30:39,5,2015,6,24

1794,disappointing shipping,the reason for this review is mainly for this other thoughts section and unfortunately it s directed at newegg i ordered parts for a brand new build all at once expecting them to come from different places as newegg has distribution centers across the us indeed the tower case and a few other items started from the east coast while these ssds came from the west coast also from the west coast was some platter hdds cpu and ram however the ssds came in a separate shipment from the hdds cpu and ram rather than ship them all in one box they came in two i do not have an issue with this nor would i have had an issue if they had arrived over the course of a few days what does upset me is that they were delivered on the same day on the same truck but in two wildly different packages and packaging quality the hdds cpu and ram came in a well handled box with plenty of air packaging to reduce bumps during shipping the ssds however were in a box absolutely mangled looking as if the box had fallen out once every 100 miles from ca to ut what s worse is that all of the air packing had been deflated so it was just a bunch of plastic surrounding the boxes containing the drives to me it seems as if newegg warehousing was just abusing the no moving part ness of ssds and thew them in with air wrap that has deflated over time in order to re use plastic and cut costs even more so i would be mostly fine with all of this but the fact that i had two boxes come in different states the one containing properly inflated wrapping and good care having plenty of space to fit two ssds and the other with poor packing just shows some deliberate packing choices on newegg s part the ssds have passed all stress tests i ve thrown at them and i still intend to run them in raid 0 but it was disappointing to have a distributor such as newegg one that i love and trust treat a package so poorly,high capacity and performing ssds,nothing significant,week,2015-06-23 19:31:29,5,2015,6,23

1835,very nice,,1 its a samsung the best in ssd s bar none 2 its 500gb 3 its in my pc4 it didn t cost an arm and a leg 5 it came with a free 128gb pny usb3 0 flash drive,read and write times are exactly as advertised no need to give benchmarks the price difference between the 120 250 500gb was a no brainer get the 500gb you won t regret it,week,2015-06-02 01:52:46,5,2015,6,2

1858,10 times faster even on old systems,these are my first ssd s i am appropriately impressed even knowing what to expect i will be building a new system soon and will be buying samsung again,sequential read and writes are 10 times faster and random read write are about 100 times fasteri know boot times are faster but on my older systems they are not 10 seconds shutdowns though are about 5 seconds very nice bought two of these they are very stable no problems yet,no 3 5 bay adapter and no usb adapter to work with migration softwarenot big issues especially since i ran clean installs but still issues,year,2015-05-24 20:17:44,5,2015,5,24
1859,works as expected,i have an 840 evo and with two firmware updates i finally have a reliable drive as long as i access the data all the time with the 850 evo samsung has figured out their reliability problems and made a fast power efficient drive that i don t expect to have problems with the 850 evo was a great price for 256gb it installed in my t420 without problems the t420 had a 360gb spinner and the ssd was a major improvement,fast and lightweight,doesn t make coffee,week,2015-05-23 17:02:34,5,2015,5,23
1860,the 30 day ssd,the freezing hanging frequency steadily climbed to the point i was sure it was just the drive i was able to clone it to a mx200 which is ever so slightly slower in write speeds but hasn t stuttered once only got a few windows dump files to look at because the drive couldn t be written to when it froze happy with the mx200 so far but now i m stuck with a 200 flaky faulty product i don t need or want,fast for 30 days,works just long enough you can t return it flaky feels like it was rushed to market fresh w7 install went great then after a few weeks started to get random hangs freezes sometimes during windows load at boot sometimes during performance tests magician and as ssd sometimes just anytime at times if i was patient it would unfreeze on it s own but it would muck up whatever it was in the middle of,year,2015-05-23 12:24:06,1,2015,5,23

1862,awesome ssd,i used this to upgrade from a samsung 830 128gb in my son s computer the samsung software was great and transferred in about 5 mins or less even using sata ii connections my only non complaint is that the new ssd paint design is a step back to me just pretty much plain black overall i couldn t be more happy with this product,fastlooks amazing easy setup and transfer,none,month,2015-05-22 15:32:16,5,2015,5,22
1863,wow old motherboard runs now,samsung magician software sets many options to optimize your system for performance or reliability with a few clicks,this drive doubled the speed of 2009 amd sata ii motherboard with ssd connected through syba sata iii raid pcie 4 port marvel 88se9230 chip adapter to boot windows 7 speed throughput increased from 248 write and 259 read to 433 write and 443 read no requirement to use raid for this speed windows will load drivers samsung 850 evo really feels like jump to light speed,none,year,2015-05-22 10:12:27,5,2015,5,22
1864,good cheap software ok,,drives are fast and cheap for capacity made my life better with no need to wait for loading and no annoying hdd noise,the magician software is okay it will do optimizations for you but i found that they can hinder stability performance on the reliability profile for optimization it will lower paging file size to a low amount for users with low ram whereas i use 8gb you can find that the system will be starved for extra memory and can cause programs to crash close even after manually adjusting settings the profiles on the program sometimes will overwrite the new changes,year,2015-05-22 02:05:37,4,2015,5,22
1865,samsung evo,have installed plenty of evo 840s and no failures only issue being the common slowdown over time in which was fixed after samsung released the patch utility and no problems since only time will tell on the 850 if it will stay a reliable competitor like the 840 was,pciked up a couple of these and so good so far good speeds and no configuration issues,none,year,2015-05-21 20:26:57,5,2015,5,21
1866,reality vs hype,shame on samsung they have a niche in ssd sales but i was foolish to believe the hype from internet shills that praised this ssd shucks i m still cautious in believing the reliability of any ssd in the future compared to hard drives the jury is still out on whether a user can include a page file on an ssd or not or even system restore features it all depends who s conning you a shill web site or an actual engineer not employed by the manufacturer ssd prices are still relatively as high as the promises vendors make comments welcome,newegg prompt deliverythe ssd workedoh yeah it s faster than a regular mechanical hdthe price is competitive to a degree but other sites were 20 cheaper the day after i bought it,the performance is comparable to a slug when stacked up against other similar ssds vertical nand and sata iii are merely promos for samsung making a cheaper to manufacture ssd kudos to them saving money and making more profit i will do extensive research and pay more for proof that an ssd is faster than previous ssds in the past buzz words mean nothing in reality based performance i wish i could share the web site that compared it with others a big jump in performance i think not try an ssd performance test utility yourself i ve tried several would you have comcast test your actual download speed no,month,2015-05-21 12:36:36,3,2015,5,21
1867,great drive,i bought this drive to replace my less spacious 128gb ocz vertex 4 that i bought back in 2012 i m still using an older board that doesn t support sata 6g but with sata 3g it caps out at the max capable speed but it s still much faster than a platter drive with my sata 3g motherboard i ran read write tests on the ssd and compared it to a platter drive and it stopped at around 200 mb s which is expected for the motherboard i have and the platter drive peaked around 100 mb s i purchased another drive on 5 20 when the deal was too good to pass up to use in my asus 750jm laptop as a boot drive and will load a few programs that i frequently use i should see full speeds on the laptop and will be able to see the full capabilities of the drive,it s fast 5 year warranty 3 months so far and no problems with the drive the price continues to drop making it a great choice for anyone who s looking to buy an ssd windows boots up in seconds it s like driving through a tiny town if you blink you ll miss it it s that fast,it s not free yet it s just a bare drive without any hardware so make sure you have a way to mount it in your case if you re mounting it in a desktop and make sure you have a sata cable available,year,2015-05-21 11:50:16,5,2015,5,21
1868,great ssd,only had it fully up and running a day so im not sure if its going to fail but its running strong so far and definitely worth the upgrade,as of right now its running smoothly just installed windows and all the updates and disabled hibernation its running great is an os drive boots windows 7 in 8 to 10 seconds consistently,when you buy a ssd you generally think you get better boot loading times that may be true but in my case i migrated all my personal folders ie my documents downloads videos etc to a western digital 2tb boot times went from 8 seconds to 20 to 30 still not bad just didn t expect it to be as much as it was price dropped literately 1 day after i bought it i payed 120 and before i even got the ups tracking code it dropped to 100 i guess thats my kind of luck,week,2015-05-21 11:47:27,4,2015,5,21

1872,best performance i ve seen,,from power on to os login screen is roughly 3 seconds i tried budget ssds and didn t understand why units like this one cost so much more for the same storage capacity look at the read write speeds and you ll find out why sure the others will do good enough and be better than disc drives but the speed boost on this was worth the extra money,none,year,2015-05-19 06:57:07,5,2015,5,19

1874,happy,samsung magician has issues with some games glitching out of full screen mode or not responding in full screen but that s no big deal since you can close it for the game if you re of a mind and they know about the issue,of course high speed vs my old wd black quick pc startup etc,having to figure out that the ahci driver included with my old 1366 driver was the cause of drive not working when you couldn t see the log files not so good thankfully there are several good tutorials online for ssd setup though so that was just time consuming,year,2015-05-18 19:28:00,5,2015,5,18

1880,defective rma,i would really like this not to be a pattern of samsung s or ssds in general,i m told it s fast,it s a fairly simple process to connect the sata data and power so it seems the ssd shipped to me in a completely non functioning state it s unrecognized in the bios and in the windows partitions and format drive utility having to rma and be without the drive that was going to hold all of my data so essentially i have no computer until i wait for it to ship out and be reshipped to me,week,2015-05-15 14:04:22,1,2015,5,15

1883,superspeed,windows will recognize the drive if your bios uefi is set to either ahci or ide just not raid remember of course we don t want to use anything except ahci you can still get raid arrays while your motherboard is set ahci of course just use windows disk management to create the arrays by striping two physical disks into the number of raid 0 partitions you want i use twin 500gb seagate cudas formatted into two raid 0 partitions drives e and f in my system it s commonly called software raid but it runs 99 as fast as so called hardware raid as far as i can see i think but don t know that samsung has done something to make these drives invisible to windows under a raid controller because sometimes the trimm commands are not passed through the raid drivers even though they are supposed to be ahci compatible windows configures hardware raid as scsi devices so that might be the problem it s all really moot however because just one of these ssd s in ahci mode boots window far faster than any raid 0 mechanical drive configuration i have ever seen love it,fantastic product faster than i thought it would be a quality ssd like this 250gb samsung 850 ssd is the closest thing in performance to a ram disk you can buy great buy as an os boot disk win10x64 boots in 8 seconds and i mean a full boot not just to the desktop screen this drive comes with a 5 year warranty longer than anyone else s afaik except another samsung ssd which has a 10 year warranty,windows 7 8 1 10 will not recognize the 850 as a bios uefi raid device so beware of that it s weird when set to uefi raid my 970 gaming motherboard properly detects the device at boot and it is visible in the efi but windows absolutely will not see the drive after that even though i m using ahci compatible raid drivers that see all of my other non raid array drives partitions without a problem however there is a solution which is why i gave it 5 stars anyway,week,2015-05-13 09:20:14,5,2015,5,13

1941,it all depends,that s it just do your homework and make sure if you buy a samsung ssd that your bios will support running in the ahci enabled mode,well it is quiet starts right up runs cool and is faster than my old hard drive and my external usb 3 0 ssd and sata and thumb drives that being said it is operating at far less than its capacity my computer card is not sata iii but rather sata the real bugaboo is that after i get this drive and after i install it and after i load the copy and data from my old sata drive it tells me that the ahci is not enabled and i need to enable it to get the best performance out of my new ssd drive so i go to the bios and guess what it is not an option to enable the ahci mode after several hours of researching i find that it will never be possible on my computer to run either the raid mode or the ahci mode so i am just stuck with having a drive that has all the benefits that i mentioned but will never live up to its potential in my desk top owing to the bios limitations of my motherboard etc oh well my only complaint would be this information should be on the box or they should have an online program that evaluates the system of your machine and then tells you what ssd you should purchase i believe crucial does this but samsung at least did not do it with this drive and on newegg that is why i gave it a 3 rather than higher,just poor communication that s all i keep thinking as happy as i am with the new life breathed into my old compaq and the reliability factor of not always worrying about when or if the drive will fail how much happier i would be if i could receive the maximum benefit of the ssd with the quality of samsung,month,2015-04-23 18:23:28,3,2015,4,23

1943,fast ssd,this isn t a con but the only way i could get this drive working in windows 8 1 pro 64x was to split it into 2 partitions the evga z97 stinger motherboard bios detected it windows detected it but i couldn t format it until i broke it into 2 500 gb partitions i thought i missed a step or perhaps i did something wrong with the initial setup but i also purchased the 500gb drive same model and it installed with no issues at all just an other thought,fasts lots of capacity fast lots of capacity,none,month,2015-04-23 12:52:02,5,2015,4,23

1946,good ssd,,i got this ssd because it was a really good price for the storage and write speeds and also because samsung is a good brand it does come with software for if you want to migrate clone your current hdd over to it so that s a plus i had to be difficult and just do fresh installs for my os and such but i did check out the software to see how it worked pretty easy in my opinion,no real cons except ssds are so much smaller it has to hang out in my case without being supported until i get a way to affix it to one of the drive bays lol,month,2015-04-23 07:42:51,4,2015,4,23

1951,if you have the time and need a hobby,in my experience the samsung cloning software is a joke i see from other reviews that it worked perfectly for some and not at all for others in my case with a fully patched win7 system it runs for half an hour or so and then reveals that if there are some problem the cloning may fail when acknowledged there is a several second pause followed by cloning failed 400180 061b34 naturally neither samsung nor the cloning tool s author apparently clonix co ltd provide any clue as to what may be wrong i ran the win7 disk check with all correction enabled it completed without incident but a second attempt to clone also failed i ve set it aside and if i have a spare day will try to install it in a linux box where i will have no illusions that any of the samsung software will work,price was right it seems to contain the storage claimed,the samsung provided software is a joke it fails to properly install the second and vital package when install all is selected once the cloning software has been forced to install it does not in my experience work see below the documentation for the software is one step beyond hieroglyphs with essentially no text precisely zero information regarding error codes or conditions,month,2015-04-21 20:20:28,2,2015,4,21

1956,kept freezing,this money for this item is non refundable so what am i going to do with it if i can t use it,it is fast when it works,i couldn t use it for a long time it just kept freezing the computer moreover i tried to clone and it kept freezing the computer so i did a clean install and it was still freezing i guess it is not compatible with my computer and i googled the freezing problem and others are having the same problem,week,2015-04-20 16:33:05,1,2015,4,20
1957,incredible ssd,not really too important but this hovers at 35 0c for me which is 7 0c warmer than my intel 530 and 5 0c warmer than my silicon power s60 i am not interested in the rapid mode as your data will be lost if a power outage happens due to it being stored in ram at the time the speeds from it are great in benchmarks but there is very little difference actually noticed in typical computing as i stated before it does not come with a sata cable but they re cheap so it s not a big deal,bought this when it was on sale for 170 one of the best purchases made for my build absolutely incredible read speeds mirrored my windows install from an old intel 530 in 5 minutes my bios splash screen takes longer to boot than windows pushing the power button until windows boots to desktop takes about 10 15 seconds,does not come with sata cable as others have mentioned the software isn t that great but that s not worth docking any eggs since that s not the ssd fault all i used it for was mirroring the old ssd nothing wrong with the ssd itself though,month,2015-04-20 12:28:21,5,2015,4,20
1958,fast and reliable,please make sure if you are installing a fresh copy of windows on any ssd that will be your boot drive to ensure that all other drives are unplugged as windows put an entry onto my other disk s boot sector so i can t boot without the otherdrive unless i re install,very fast drive maxes out sata 6gb s bandwidth in most cases i use the drive for booting win 8 1 and gaming boot time is below 10s and i am in the first few to load into levels in games,0 issues so far,year,2015-04-20 08:58:32,5,2015,4,20
1959,great ssd bad software,though the ssd diagnostic tool works well do not use the cloning software provided i recommend acronis true imagemacrium reflect free editionthese programs i had successful images created and none of the original issues presented with samsung s magician software nothing against samsung they make one hell of an ssd but they need work on the software side,the price point for this drive it on point with other drive s out there and isn t overly expensive r w speed is immense and just amazing my computer generally booted from a hdd in about 25seconds with this ssd it boots completely in 10 starting the count from the login screen add 2 3 if you want to count the windows logo screen,software the software provided for cloning your original disk image is by no means reliable looking through the event logs after cloning many errors relating to file locations appear restore points will no longer be created automatically because the software doesn t remove the old drive from its listings those are a few examples for problems you will face the biggest and hardest to diagnose is one that i faced and that was on initial boot up sometimes the bio s wouldn t find the boot manager and would fail to boot after a reset reboot it would work perfectly fine if this issue occurs its with 95 likely hood that its the image clone and not a defective drive re image the drive with another cloning tool and see if it fixes the issue or try a fresh install if possible,week,2015-04-20 08:45:57,4,2015,4,20
1960,love it win 7 boot on sata 2 under 30 seconds,yea finally got my laptop where i wanted it got a 1tb samsung 850 evo ssd for my boot drive and the new samsung 2tb spinpoint drive for my secondary drive but my system wasn t recognizing the 2tb spinpoint in the secondary sata slot drive 1 but did recognize it in the first slot drive 0 the ssd was recognized in either slot so i switched them around changed the boot order in the cmos and voila now i have 3 terabytes drive space on my laptop and with the ssd it boots windows 7 with the multitude of stuff i have running in about 30 seconds or less and response is almost instant when starting any program love it,lots of space fast maxes out sata 2 specs recognized fine on intel series 5 chipset which is know not to recognize some sata 3 drives,samsung drive migration software that comes with it is not good will not clone the entire disk just visible partitions which makes sense because it operates in the windows environment even warns you that running open files will not be cloned so probably best to use it in safe mode i would think would not clone my disk with the oem recovery partition in win 7 and 8 on 2 different laptops i used acronis true image and it did them perfectly it reboots into it s own environment to do so,month,2015-04-19 13:19:41,5,2015,4,19

1964,great pice,samsung is definitely a name you can trust their hardware and products across all mediums are solid and trustful i purchased this drive to replace the one that came with a pc i bought at the same time as the main drive the lack of mounting screws was disappointing as the screws that typically fit any drive did not want to fit this one at all i had to go through a bin of random screws to find some that would actually fit this drive and hold it in place there is no cables included with this drive so be sure to buy an extra sata cable if you need one also a power adapter if you need one as well this drive came with an instruction book on how to copy existing files over to this drive using a usb adapter that is not even included seems kind of odd to include anything like that when the parts needed are not included with the package overall a great buy great and solid drive and performs well,great sale price at the time of purchase 250gig ssdsamsung name that you can trust,drive comes with nothing but a manual quick install guide cd and the drive no mounting screws no sata cable no power adapter if needed,week,2015-04-17 15:04:21,4,2015,4,17
1965,replacing an 840 evo,love these drives upgraded from an 840 evo not really any reason to be honest however i decided that i was going to give my sons computer a boost by upgrading his slow hhd to a speedy ssd it made sense to give him my year old 840evo and upgrade to the 850evo in my rig the 850 evo is slightly faster overall but it is considerably faster with the random read and writes it does not suffer from the slow down issues that the 840evo has although i have not noticed any issues with the 840evo all in all a great drive i really like the samsung ssd s i have nothing bad to say about these drives buy one today no real reason to hold back if you have a slow hhd capacities are increasing and prices are dropping at 189 for 500gb you can t go wrong,fastcool and quieteasy to set upcloning software includedgood price,none,month,2015-04-17 13:52:05,5,2015,4,17
1966,2nd review update fixed the problem with bootup,,i was having problems with bios sometimes not detecting the 850 evo drive during boot up problem was that i had the drive plugged into my secondary sata3 0 6bb s marvell 88se9128 controller it runs of the south bridge and not directly off the intel chipset the slight delay in initializing the marvell controller during boot causes bios to not see the sdd in time to boot off of it doesn t always happen but often enough set your bios configuration to ahci and not ide or you ll have problems in the long run with drive efficiency degrading,none at all,year,2015-04-17 12:14:15,5,2015,4,17

1976,nice ssd lousy migration software,,physical installation of the drive was pretty simple the drive is very fast and i was able to successfully migrate my windows 7 partition on the first try after i figured out how to work around the limits of the brain dead migration software the magician benchmark claims about 4 5gbytes second which is surprising since the drive claims 540mbytes sec,the installation guide was pretty useless it s basically a bunch of pictures it also covers installation into a desktop system using some kind of usb adapter i would have been pretty angry if that was required but migrating data using sata cabling worked just fine the migration software itself was designed by brain dead programmers i had about 520gb of data on my system drive which i was planning to only partially migrate the migration software had an option to select files to migrate but warned me that any files i did not migrated would be deleted and that i should back them up first that is completely unacceptable any competent software guy could write software that copied the desired files and left the rest alone secondly the method to pick files to migrate or not migrate was designed just as badly i was allowed to only select files with certain extensions and no way to pick an entire directory or set of directories so i ended up spending about 5 hours repartitioning my system drive and backing up some 3 400gb of data i didn t need on my ssd so overall rating 5 for the drive itself and the driver software zero for the migration software,week,2015-04-14 19:21:46,3,2015,4,14

1981,samsung 850 evo 500gb and samsung magician,this is my first ssd and i tried to migrate from my 1tb seagate c os hhd i m running a desktop pc with an intel icore 7 8gb ram sata 3 and with ahci enabled as well as trim performance of the ssd is ok but the samsung magician migration software was a bust tried it twice with no positive results i was disappointed i then tried aomei backupper and ended up with an unhappy c os ssd it just did not seem to run properly i finally tried a restored from an existing current acronis true image c os drive backup all went well and upon installing the drive into the pc it was as if the existing seagate hdd had never left it now runs stable and it is just faster since that acronis restore and installing the ssd into my desktop pc i have waited 10 14 days to write this and i have noticed no issues i believe that in using the restore file it helps to negate any fragmentation of files that may occur using migration as well as any issues in going from a 1tb hhd to a 500gb ssd i may be wrong but this seems to make sense to me so if you are having any issues similar to mine try acronis i was shocked that it could be so far superior to samsung magician and aoemi backupper for what i wanted to do acronis did what it was supposed to and that ain t bad i do not believe other than boot that desktops users see the profound speed improvements that laptop users experience most desktops run 7200 rpm hhds whereas laptops run 5400 rpm hdds so there is an inherent slower speed from laptop hdds therefore a desktop users initial hhd speeds are far superior to laptops hdd speed so the sense of speed improvement will be far more noticeable for a laptop user do app programs and such load faster on the desktop pc yes but not enormously so also rendering videos and photoshop images etc will always show better performance using an ssd,no hibernation the drive is always accessible fast boot always a plus,samsung magician migration software at least for me,month,2015-04-13 13:00:16,4,2015,4,13

1993,has problem with sata iii add on cards,i have been using the 840 pro 256gb in two computers for over a year with no issues at all with an asus p5q pro motherboard with either 8 or 16 gb ram a processor running at 4 ghz and a generic sata iii add on card as the boot system ssd drive controller and large raid arrays as the user drives using the sata ii motherboard ports as the ssd drive was getting pretty full i thought it was time to upgrade to 500gb i have tried three different 850 evo 500gb drives and all experience file corruption within days of use hooked to the same add on port that the 840 pro works happily on samsung service states they will only support a drive with direct motherboard connections in my case that would mean reverting to the slower sata ii ports on the motherboard as if any were available with the raid so buyer beware,price is good warranty is good newegg return is good,will not work with sata iii add on board samsung will only support with direct motherboard connections,month,2015-04-10 07:43:09,1,2015,4,10

2005,thanks newegg,i had a problem with my order and newegg made it all right theres a reason why i come back here and the customer service is great,made my computer faster your storage is probably your bottleneck you may not notice a big difference right now but once you go back to an hdd based computer you ll see a significant difference this size is good for a laptop you can go smaller if you get a desktop and already have an hdd,i have no idea how to read the lba it uses a 3gb slc cache so i m not sure if its writing twice and i should be less concerned,week,2015-04-02 16:36:20,5,2015,4,2
2006,samsung 850 evo mz 75e500b,i bought this ssd to replace my slow 5400 rpm hdd that my laptop came with the boot time was unbearable the price was right so i gave it a try i am so happy i did this is the single most impressive upgrade to any pc i have ever made my boot time is at least 20 times faster my programs load at lightning speed and can multitask with no lag or hesitation very happy with this ssd i migrated my os from my hdd if you don t have a sata iii to usb 3 you will need one to migrate unless you plan on doing a fresh os install using the migration software from samsung it went without a single issue after i swapped my hard drives i booted the system and ran the magician software and did a final reboot then the benchmark tests wow average read write from my old hdd was 81 3 mb s the ssd average was 673mb s very impressed with this drive i would recommend one to anyone who wants to free up their pc performance bottleneck their hard hdd,very easy to migrate os from hdd lightning fast and imo a very fair price for the performance gain,failed to mention there is no sata3 to usb cable included no bad marks for that it was covered in the reviews so i ordered one when i ordered the ssd no bad marks for that though,week,2015-04-02 08:34:55,5,2015,4,2
2007,solid state heaven,can t wait to update my network storage with ssd but it will have to wait until costs come down a bit more,speed need i say more my wife and i installed in our lenovo a730 aio computers and wow my wife would see bootup times in excess of 2 minutes before the ssd after the ssd 30 to 45 seconds i have seen similar results we had some issues with getting the ssd to work on my wife s machine but once resolved best thing since folded napkins,price but not as bad as some other ssds,week,2015-04-02 03:38:08,5,2015,4,2

2010,good speedy drive,,i used to buy a lot of the 840 s but the 850 s are priced about the same and easier to find i haven t seen any real performance increase over the 840 s in general though these drives have been very good to me with the samsung magician tools you can quickly make some tweaks that will improve the lifespan of the drive and make it perform really well the samsung software also makes it a snap to clone your old drive,none except that i wish you could use rapid mode on more than one drive i would love to add another one to my desktop to do more video rendering work instead of using my os drive for so much read write work,year,2015-03-31 14:16:53,5,2015,3,31
2011,not recognized twice,contacted samsung microsoft and hp support to attempt to fix the issue with no success i will have to get a different make of ssd i used an intel in the system with no issues except purchasing too small of a size,looks nice,was not recognized on anything but bios all attempts to get windows7 to recognize it were fruitless returned the first for a replacement and the second behaved the same way,week,2015-03-31 10:48:08,2,2015,3,31

2015,ahci implemented second review,i tested this with real files not a benchmark application the 850 evo is a solid well supported ssd i strongly recommend it,o k its fast really fast almost as fast as my adata x900 without the performance enhancements provided by the samsung software from my adata to my samsung well over 200mbs that is fast i used various files to test this,without ahci implementation and the samsung software it didn t beat the adata ax900 i only gained storage space,week,2015-03-29 16:38:35,5,2015,3,29
2016,please with purchase,i purchased this with the intent of cloning my hard drive to this new samsung ssd i didn t use their cloning software so i can t comment on the quality of it i used the acronis brand since i already has a copy of it no issues at all replacing the drive i m really pleased the decreased scan times for searches and antivirus as well as the very noticeable decrease in reboot time win 7 i haven t done any actual benchmarks but it s easy to tell that my pc is more responsive,extremely fast lightweight quiet this purchase came with a free adapter so i could fit this smaller form factor hard drive in a larger 3 5 bay which is great,none to report,month,2015-03-29 12:10:12,5,2015,3,29
2017,10 out of 10,i ve owned several different ssd s from several different manufacturers and so far samsung takes the cake in all categories every manufacturer is going to ship out a dud once in a while but your chances are minimized when getting the samsung evo series,i picked this drive up for 99 shipped a couple weeks ago compare that to the 840 evo 250gb that i bought a year ago at 180 and thought that was a deal oh well i m glad storage prices are on the down again samsung ssd s are top of the line reliability and performance are hard to beat especially for the price i m now running this ssd in raid 0 block level striped performance in combination with the afore mentioned 840 evo both attached to sata3 ports during setup of this configuration i learned to watch out for mixing sata2 and sata3 ports on a raid configuration or you might experience corrupted files or volumes with extreme difficulty troubleshooting the problem i almost sent the ssd back for rma most reviewers are going to provide you with some single drive performance numbers so i won t beat a dead horse instead here are my raid 0 performance numbers for your enjoyment atto v2 47 256mb length direct i o neither mode file size read speed write speed 1kb 19mb s 24mb s4kb 59mb s 61mb s64kb 347mb s 406mb s1mb 884mb s 909mb s8mb 1015mb s 1045mb sfor the first time ever i was able to break the 1gb s barrier the samsung magician software shows similar performance results as well as hd tune v2 55 i m very very pleased with these ssd s,i have no cons about the drive itself it s a perfect 10 as far as i m concerned however i wish the drive came with a 3 5 to 2 5 bracket because i m running out and keep having to order more i also wish it came with a sata cable running out of those too,month,2015-03-28 11:42:51,5,2015,3,28

2020,i bought another one,it is getting harder to trust them,still the fastest thing out there good durability,still a bit pricey unclear if this series will suffer same problem as all of the 840 series of massive decrease in read speed for data not used recently with no apparent move to replace the affected devices attempts by samsung at fixing the problem have failed only offer so far has been to rma the device and they will send you a refurbished replacement no way instructions still not good i tried the data migration from the cd again first one of these i bought it would not work at all this one worked but it generated a message before starting warning that any open files will not be copied if this is true this is not a way to migrate you existing disk have they not heard of shadow copy or the various techniques use by pretty much all of the backup products that will clone a drive clone a new drive without any of the open files duh,week,2015-03-26 16:07:44,4,2015,3,26
2021,awesome,,i received the samsung 850 evo ssd a few days ago and installed in in a matter of minutes the data migration only took about 35 minutes and could not have been any easier the software is simple to use and easy to follow i can go from a cold start to being online in 30 seconds now love this ssd i am picking up a second one in a week or so,only con is that this does not come with anything other than the ssd and the software i had to use some old mounting screws to mount the ssd to my bracket installed this in my desktop and a spare cable not taking anything off for this as i knew this when i ordered the ssd,week,2015-03-26 08:53:28,5,2015,3,26

2030,gone bad,i did a rma to replace it however it cost me an additional 9 99 to ship it back plus the drive sell for 10 less than i paid for it on 3 5 not very happy with paying to replace a drive that failed less than 3 weeks after i purchased it,i received the drive on time and it was easy to install and worked great very fast,three days after i had completely installed os and applications the drive failed i turned it off and several hours later i returned and tried to access the system and it would not boot up check the data and power cables and kept getting the same message,month,2015-03-22 15:03:47,1,2015,3,22
2031,initial impression great,i ll report back if any issues arise this is just a nitpick of mine but i was hoping by going with an ssd rated at 500gb it would be the full sum as opposed to another ssd rated at 512gb the 850 evo shows 465gb of actual space before installing any os my mx100 rated at 512gb shows 477gb,slick look shows through my murcury s3 case about as fast as my force gs 360 was ssds are awesome,none really see other thoughts,week,2015-03-22 13:10:31,5,2015,3,22

2038,only thing better is an 850 pro,after optimizing with the samsung magician software it did speed up the system with it set to longevity and not performance the system is still incredibly snappy and boot time with all software installed from pressing the power button to an idle desktop is 27 seconds i highly recommend this drive unless you can afford an 850 pro,speedsamsung magician softwarecomes with data migration software but have not tried it,none,week,2015-03-20 02:24:45,5,2015,3,20

2046,nothing but happy,some reviews have said windows 7 clean install will not recognize the drive it will you have to select new on the install window when you are selecting the drive for windows to install on so it will format the drive as needed ive tested a few of the drives for speed depending on your processor they perform near or at the speed advertised when using the rapid boost option in the samsung software fyi you don t need to use the samsung software in win 7 or higher however you can install the software then optimize the drive then uninstall the software and it will remain as optimized excluding the rapid boost i run a pro pair in raid 0 and have a third evo as a ghost backup drive i connect with a usb adapter tip for the migration be sure to disable your antivirus and make sure your windows updates are current prior to doing the migration quarantined sections of the disk can run into problems migrating and windows updates can mess with the os if it is trying to migrate system files while they are set up for an update that is going in on the next shutdown,ive used and installed 6 samsung 850 evo ssd on mine and friends desktops and laptops not a single hitch fast as advertised when installed with a good mb and fast cpu the free disk migration software is a big plus the ssd cartridge is light alloy and sharp looking,the boost mode can cause some games to glitch and crash i turned boost off and have not had a problem since the speed difference is slightly measurable in benchmarks however not noticeable in games or desktop functions,year,2015-03-16 07:53:42,5,2015,3,16

2049,boots and loads very fast,not worth taking away an egg but the documentation is very simple and assumes you are installing on a laptop i am very tech savvy but for someone not as experienced installation may be a little more difficult i will say the migration software is very well done,after installing an evo 840 on my new pc i decided to install the evo 850 on my wife s laptop boots and loads software much faster now even tho the laptop has a sata ii interface it is still very fast got it on sale and the price was very good,documentation see other thoughts,year,2015-03-15 10:57:18,5,2015,3,15
2050,fast but software doesn t support raid,samsung does list the incompatibility with raid in their software documentation which i recommend reading before purchasing and installing the drive it can currently be found on the downloads tab of the ssd support page on the samsung website data migration without using samsung s bundled utility was accomplished easily using the disk clone feature in the free version of easeus todo backup some samsung magician functionality can also be easily accomplished using freely available applications e g performance benchmark secure erase while other functionality appears to be completely unavailable e g rapid mode over provisioning firmware update,speed,the bundled software does not work with raid,week,2015-03-14 12:57:08,3,2015,3,14

2058,good buy,glad i picked this up a couple weeks ago when it was 30 cheaper,space and cost at the time of purchase the speed of this drive is excellent and it works well almost identical speed to the samsung 840 pro 256 gb i replaced this with it also scores a 7 9 wei for windows 7 x64 ultimate in case anyone is wondering,my computer takes longer to post after installing this but that might be due to a power cable i damaged on my secondary storage drive when performing the installation it could also be that my bios might need an update to recognize this faster regardless i was expecting a noticeable performance difference over the 256gb 840 pro it was replacing if anything this drive might be a hair slower but the difference is really not that noticeable and i needed the space,month,2015-03-11 09:36:15,4,2015,3,11
2059,works good but its not worth the effort,i received this ssd after purchasing a new gaming laptop i wanted to boot games as fast as possible my laptop has two drive bays so i installed it first i used the migration tool on the disc provided by samsung after a successful migration i would boot from the ssd it was very glitchy slow load times programs crash or don t work at all i formatted and attempted a migration a number of times with the same tool and easus tool problems still persist i spoke with samsung about the issue and they told me to do a secure format and provided me with an iso to make a bootable disc to do so after that the problems still existed i spoke to samsung again and was told that a migration of an os will never be perfect and that i needed to do a clean install of the os computers don t come with discs anymore so i found a tool developed by microsoft to create an installation disc from a flash drive finally after all the trouble a clean install has worked after doing all this i ve come to the conclusion that shavings mere seconds off your boot and load times aren t justified after all the tedious work not to mention samsung provides a tool and then claims that it doesn t work as well as a fresh install i would ve been more satisfied knowing at the time of purchase that i d need a fresh os installation in the end i don t think its worth it however it does work and does it very well the experience was just annoying,computer boots in 27 seconds games load very quickly,difficult to set up long exhausting process,month,2015-03-11 05:02:24,4,2015,3,11
2060,samsung 850 evo,so far it has been stable and fast and it was nice to have the data migration software also the software magician is nice as well so you can get even more speed out of it,this hard drive went into my gamming pc it replaced 1 tb mechanical hdd right off it was very noticeable how fast it boots and increased speed of programs games load much faster,only con is that it is a little pricey,month,2015-03-10 14:33:49,5,2015,3,10
2061,not much to add to the other glowing reviews here,i never realized how much noise laptop hard drives made until i installed this ssd as a replacement now the only noise comes from my typing mouse clicking and the occasional use of the cpu fan,fast and quiet when i have it on battery the laptop that the drive is in certainly lasts longer than when the 5400 rpm hard drive was in there if you want specifics of why you should get this ssd over any others that are out there then there are other reviewers who have done that better than i can the 5 year warranty does separate it from most everybody else who usually offer only 3 year warranties,none at this time,month,2015-03-09 12:35:30,5,2015,3,9
2062,solid states rule hdd s die,this is my sixth samsung ssd and my ninth ssd yet i bought it because the price per gb is good and it should be very reliable i have 5 840 evo drives and have never had an issue with one this particular drive is for data storage in a home server based on current test data of drives and experience with spinners this should outlast any spinner in just about any application thus i bought this my application is closer to cataloging so i am on the really safe side if i have issues i will be sure to update this review to reflect them,fast good price for solid state reliable,non,month,2015-03-08 21:06:17,5,2015,3,8

2068,not what i was expecting,go with the 840 evo for now i am sure samsung will leverage 3d technology in the future and it will beat up the 840 series good enough until then disappoints,first off samsung rocks plain and simple this is a good drive but not worthy of the premium compared to the 840 evo the only thing you get right now is longevity compared to the evo,i didn t see much of a performance difference between my 840 s and this 850 rapid mode was actually slow on the 850 and my workstation runs a xeon cpu with 20gb of ram performance returned once i disabled it,year,2015-03-07 16:43:45,3,2015,3,7

2076,highly recommend,for people whom have never experienced ssd s before i was you and i hate myself for not doing it sooner its so unbelievably fast i have this ssd strictly for my os and critical programs i launch on windows startup not exaggerating at all once it gets passed the starting windows screen it takes 3 seconds to go from that screen to opening my internet browser and you know when sometimes your computer says needs to restart to finish installing updates and you dreaded it all along because it was an inconvenience its no longer an inconvenience at night when i shut my computer down when i click shut down i immediately get out of my chair and leave the room about 10 feet by the time i get to the door the computer is already off its mind blowing for the price which is incredible by the way i 100 highly recommend this ssd over any hdd very affordable and will change your computer using experience thank you samsung for making such an affordable item,very quick if your transferring from one to the other it comes with a program to where you can transfer everything right to the other without worrying about formatting anything,if this counts as a con its almost too fast if you click something on your computer that s on the ssd and didn t mean to click it well too bad because its gonna be open within 1 second,year,2015-03-04 11:55:17,5,2015,3,4

2079,can you love an upgrade,with laptops running 5400rpm hds this upgrade will be immediately apparent to the user your limiting spec is your hard drive when launching programs this ssd makes sure you are not waiting on it,so i bought this ssd to go with my newer mid level gaming laptop ran a few small tests prior with my old 1tb 5400rpm w 8gb sd i had a 22 second startup with another 10 seconds to be able to fully launch a web browser immediately after start up also ran a hd benchmark and got an overall score of 667 that s a low tier hd with the 850 evo startup of 7 sec with immediate browser launch benchmark score 4567 everything loads very fast multitasking has not been the same since i got this and now i m spoiled,i don t know how i feel about the samsung software yet i like that it tracks my use which can give me a better idea on the life of the drive but the other features seem unnecessary optimization benchmarks ect would prefer if it ran in the background without launching the user interface because i usually dislike a bunch of hardware programs running on my icon bar,week,2015-03-02 07:44:18,5,2015,3,2

2083,not impressed with performance,it s a fast drive i m wondering if samsung still needs to work a few bugs out of the firmware but even at the current speeds it s faster than any home user needs,i had an existing 512gb ssd which i needed to upgrade due to capacity limitations my preferred brand is ocz but as they don t make a 1tb sata drive and samsung is quite the the leader in ssd manufacturing and the price per gb was nice i decided to go with this drive i chose the evo over the pro as multiple review sites have stated that non professional users will not benefit from the extra features and durability of pro drives,after using cloning software not the included software to prepare it and enabling rapid i ran samsung s benchmark in samsung magician to compare its performance to my ocz vector and vertex 460 which i use for my games and temp files page file respectively sequential read and write speed is at 938 2566mb s respectively as a result of rapid but the 64280 iops read and 35926 iops write speed is well below samsung s specification it is using the latest firmware emt01b6q,week,2015-02-28 19:57:48,4,2015,2,28

2088,so far so good,i was a little apprehensive about installing in my laptop as i had never installed an ssd drive and read a lot of horror stories but i was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly the install went i was a little concerned that my sql server and associated databases would not migrate properly but after firing up the machine with the ssd installed everything is working as it did before only quicker boot time to login screen went from about 40 seconds down to about 10 seconds and the machine is fully up within a minute i m logging into a domain so it does take a bit longer than a non domain machine but even the login happened faster the d630 is an older machine with a 4gb max ram capacity which had me thinking of getting a new laptop but for a buck and a quarter it acts like a different machine and now performs close to as well as a new machine with a sata drive needless to say i m putting off the new laptop purchase for a while at this early point i m pretty happy with it,easy to install or at least was in my dell d630migration tool worked flawlessly,none so far,day,2015-02-26 14:48:07,5,2015,2,26

2092,samsung ssd,if you buy this drive make sure you remember to purchase the sata cables also make sure you use the new versions of the software from samsung s site if you using this in a desktop computer you do not need the usb to sata adapter as it is pictured in the directions and like people have blogged all over the internet the recommended sata iii cable is a 6 0gb s that cable is backwards compatible for sata ii and sata check your mother board specifications to know which type of sata port you have and purchase the cable that is for that port because not all motherboards are created equal or just get the sata iii and cover all your bases even in the 3 0g s port w the respective 3 0g s cable this drive benchmarked at the manufacturers specifications as strange as that sounds looking online you will be told what other people think rather then what is truly recommended by the manufacturer which by the way is not marked on their product anywhere or on samsung s site also make sure to use the software supplied by the manufacture called samsung magician from their site not their included cd contrary to what people blog and think it does increase the longevity of your drive by creating an extra partition and also gives you the rapid mode feature that is unbelievably effective also the software helps you set the drive for optimization and over provisioning important little tools that make this drive easier to use and maintain i hope this helps and the drive like i said performs better then the manufacturer s specifications in my case but just like cpu s and gpu s they do not all perform the same but they do at least perform to the minimum specifications provided by the manufacturer i am very happy with this purchase other then the cd software issues and the cable not being included,speed and size this drive benchmarks over the specifications that it was sold under it is fast if not faster then i expected i gave it 4 eggs because of the issues explained in the cons it really was a hassle because and not user friendly because of those issues hopefully with my explanation you can avoid the hours i spent trying to install this drive,this drive did not come with anything other then the drive it s self so i had to order the sata iii cables after it arrived the software on the cd that came with the drive did not work and kept stopping during installation and giving me error codes it also said it could not find the drive and many other strange error codes came up i had to download the newer versions of the software from samsung s site and then it installed correctly the funny part was when i went to clone my original mechanical drive the software said the source disk was the ssd and the destination disk was the ssd and gave me no other options to change this i let it run anyway and it actually copied my original hdd to the ssd without an issue,week,2015-02-26 10:17:05,4,2015,2,26

2096,stupidly fast ssd stupidly quirky software,advice from experience buy this ssd in any capacity you simply cannot get more bang for your buck in performance with either the evo or the pro light years ahead of the competition magician can will improve the performance of your ssd phenomenally but install it and use it with care do these things first 1 read the manual the quid pro quos of do s and do not s take up two full pages 2 with this in mind set up your bios uefi3 install the os any necessary missing drivers for your mobo and hardware and only the most important user software and anti virus you need to run flawlessly on your new build 4 update everything except kb3004394 windows has pulled this update on all win7 and server 2008 machines but users it also conflicts with software on win8 machines if you have this update installed uninstall and hide it or the sorcerer will freeze your new build don t ask how i know this 5 back up any user data you cannot lose 6 create a restore point unless you find the words refresh and restore strangely comforting 7 install magician8 try out one feature at a time test the feature and create a restore point after each successful feature 9 once you have a stable machine with the magician features you like install the rest of your software create restore points and enjoy the performance samsung magician works flawlessly for most users but if your uefi your windows updates your drivers magician options or some other part of your configuration is not to samsung s liking you may experience a frozen os a frozen ssd and will need to resort to the previous configuration os optimization only works on one drive do not apply it to more than one or you will crash both magician and the system rapid is an excellent performance enhancement feature but it does not play well with some irst drivers which perform some of the same enhancements as samsung rapid read the manual and install only compatible irst drivers secure data has three modes and only uses one mode do not activate more than one not only will magician crash it will crash your new build and you will need to revert to your restore point samsung is actively working on compatibility issues esp with rapid and listens to the forums for feedback but they have consistently had issues since 2011 don t hold your breath install update backup and restore the most lucky and persistent users are able to make magician work for them but if you have problems you will spend time looking for technical answers on the forums good luck,speed 2nd fastest ssd out there and a close second only to the pro series for a significant increase in price achieved roughly the advertised ios without installing the magician software installation stupidly simple on a clean installation just install the device in your build set your uefi bios install the os and viola there is are your drive s in all their blistering fast glory win8 1 installs in less than 20 minutes if you are the bottleneck and loads in 8 seconds without any fast boot bios setup if you are a photo editor you won t have time to even sip your coffee,samsung magician does not play well with others it is the most finicky software i have installed on any machine in over 25 years i almost subtracted three eggs for this except the ssd performs flawlessly and admirably without it if i could review the software alone magician would get only one egg on the one hand if samsung magician likes your build not only will your ssd meet or match advertised and reviewed performance it will exceed it by as much as 50 or more on the other hand if samsung the magician feels slighted in the least by your configuration it will become samsung the sorcerer and crash your machine the very word refresh will give you ptsd and restore will commit you to the institution,year,2015-02-25 02:43:10,5,2015,2,25

2154,very easy to install and use,it works amazingly well there are some tutorials showing how to use the migration software i bought the 1 tb drive so i could just pick up all of my programs data os etc and move it onto a better faster drive i was not disappointed step one back up you old hdd step two run the migration software it took me 4 hours to move 800g step three power down and unplug the old hdd step four reboot and run with the new drive there might be some tweaking involved the software that comes with this will help you with the os settings also i initially has issues launching games but after a bit of homework i discovered that the nforce sata controllers were frankly terrible for ssds which is not shocking since they weren t around when the drivers were written diablo 3 failed to load completely i swapped in the standard microsoft drivers for the nforce ones drill though system info to the device manager to the driver selection click update then tell it you want to select the driver to use and pick the standard controller driver kick nforce to the curb and problem solved i m not getting all the speed i would with a sata iii board and i know there will likely be issues with the garbage function down the road so it might start slowing in a year or two by then i plan on upgrading my system to a sweet i5 rig till then this works great i recommend it to anyone,it is small light and takes up no room to speak of the migration software is dead simple tuning software is wonderful and easy to use the connections are well made it works fine with sata iiit is very fast blazing fast compared to a standard hdd even with only sata ii it s the single simplest upgrade you can give an older system,it takes a bit of tweaking to get all of the functionality with an older motherboard like mine you have to do a bit of research to discover the issues with nforce drivers but that s not something that i would take an egg off with a newer mobo or a fresh install this is probably a breeze to use,week,2015-02-04 06:01:08,5,2015,2,4

2161,perfect drives for the job,the samsung magician software included doesn t recognize drives that are in a raid so i would advise updating the firmware if needed before you boot these into a raid,i picked up several of these to put into a raid 10 since i wanted speed and redundancy i ve had them running now for about two months and i have had no problems with them they deliver the speeds advertised and samsung continues to dominate the market with quality ssds at excellent prices i tested a single drive and it boots from bios to desktop in roughly 8 seconds in a raid 10 i get about half of that time and at this point it s probably due to the amount of ram more than anything,none,year,2015-02-01 08:57:36,5,2015,2,1

2163,fast great for speeding up,technology is technology prices always drop and deals are always there i m still not disappointed like i said the only reason i got it was to speed my laptop up,so i purchased this ssd for my alienware m14x r2 about two years ago i upgraded the hdd to a crucial m4 512gb 512gb because i games and wanted to install a lot of games however i put that ssd in my gaming desktop and for the past year i have been using the regular hdd that came with the laptop for anyone who knows about a hdd and an ssd it s night and day with the hdd it took 3 minutes to boot and forever to open up files and such i use the laptop mainly for school so my main reason for getting this ssd was for faster boot and faster loading and bringing up files i also only got the 250gb version because i only use the laptop for school and very little gaming for on the go,i only jumped on it because it s only been out a few months meaning they are fairly new and up to date in the technology world i was thinking i got such a good deal when i paid 128 99 after taxes about 3 days of it being delivered another online retailer dropped it to 109 99 meaning it would be 119 99 after taxes so i paid about 10 more but no worries because newegg is tied in my personal opinion with that other company too bad they don t price match it,week,2015-01-31 09:16:29,5,2015,1,31
2164,excellent drive but using the encryption is tricky,this drive is special because it has a feature called sed self encrypting drive it is always encrypting your data with encryption keys that it stores in its rom if you use software to delete the keys the info is useless so no need to do a government style drive wipe that reduces ssds lifespans the thing is that sed feature wasn t made for that it was made so that if your laptop or even desktop got in the wrong hands the data would be useless there is no mention of how to setup the drive to do this utilizing this feature means storing the encryption keys outside the drive and send the drive the key every time you start the computer no key no data well very few consumer boards some asrock can set an sed hd password in bios the bios holds the keys and when you type a boot password it transmits the keys to your ssd unlocking the data you probably don t have that board sooption 2if you buy a version of windows or upgrade to one that has bitlocker bitlocker has a feature that can speak to the sed ssd you must install windows using uefi there are many advantages to installing in uefi mode so i would recommend you do this no matter what if installed using uefi use a guide to bitlocker to encrypt your drive use a usb thumb drive to store your keys and back them up somewhere else and put them in a safe or something if you do things correctly bitlocker will not inform you that it has to take time to encrypt the data in your drive if bitlocker tells you this you are doing software encryption which is not as secure and it is slower google bitlocker sed for more info,one of the fastest drives with one of the best warranties and good utility software always encrypting your data on the fly making secure wipes instant and final,absolutely no guide or help on how to utilize the encryption sed that is already happening to secure your computer to secure erase the drive you must run software from a bootable usb or cd and usually you have to unplug a running drive and plug it back in while the software is running this can be difficult for some people and especially laptop users,year,2015-01-30 16:00:29,5,2015,1,30

2171,not magically fast,this is my first samsung ssd and the reason i bought it was all the hype i don t know maybe it s just me but i m not terribly impressed by the 850 evo it might be the light plastic feel when i picked it up i m just not sure but it s not doing anything for me it s possible i m just becoming blasé at ssds they don t hold the technological mystery they once did they re becoming utilitarian like mice or keyboards or hard drives,i m replacing a 120g corsair neutron gtx that s a little over a year old it s installed in my production machine that has an asus maximus genevii motherboard and a haswell i5 processor i use this machine every day for standard chores including a lot of downloading internet surfing and burning tons of bluray discs it has 8 gigs of memory and uses the built in intel graphics the corsair ssd was always lightening quick and dead reliable it really didn t need replacing because i store everything on a 3 gig hard drive but i guess i just wanted to see what the hype was with the samsung drives to be honest the samsung seems no faster or more responsive then the neutron it s quick for sure but not magically fast the experience is exactly the same i will give the samsung magician software my highest praise for doing everything you might ever need or think you need rapid mode didn t seem to make any difference in speed and adds approximately ten seconds to the boot time the os optimization section contains almost every os trick you d ever want to know and of course there is an included trim applet very complete and very user friendly and included with the drive on one of those miniature discs it has a 5 year warranty which is better than most ssds although this is new technology and who knows how it will fare a few years from now,it s certainly fast but not enough of a performance jump to necessitate upgrading from any recent performance ssd the drive is bare bones and all that s included is the magician software disc does not have a quality feel to it but this is a subjective appraisal on my part it s expensive or at least in comparison to other drives of the same performance tier,year,2015-01-25 15:55:15,4,2015,1,25

2185,stellar drive especially when on sale,not a con in any way on the device nor anything worth taking an egg off for but installing this lead to the discovery that my board s uefi was non functional and its boot order was out of whack moral of the story is pay attention to warning signs for simple upgrades can reveal much larger issues additionally i bought this when the evo 850 first hit the market and was being sold for a mere 122 with shipping,extremely fast read write speeds installs windows very quickly and boots very quickly as well from drive detection to login screen takes approximately 10 seconds which is a huge step up from my previous 64gb sandisk ssd,it s not a pci e ssd i guess it wasn t free the sales on it now aren t as good as the ones immediately after the holidays,month,2015-01-17 13:23:16,5,2015,1,17

2202,not as expected,i know ssd performance varies a lot in real world but this 850 evo is very unstable on the ssd user benchmark i guess that samsung will issue a firmware update soon i purchased this ssd the very first week released,none just about the same performance of my aging 830 evo,just for the record i m a it manager in a advertising agency i purchased this drive to replace my 18 month samsung 830 evo ssd to be honest there is no big difference in performance between my 830 and this 850 this 850 evo only lasted 3 weeks and came up booting with a bsod my old 830 is still going strong,month,2015-01-07 22:20:45,2,2015,1,7
2203,solid,overall i am still very please with the drive the performance and reliability and would highly recommend the 500gb to anyone looking for a ssd,fast and reliable i bought this drive for a micro pc to use as both a stream entertainment box and a travel pc and i could not be happier i purchased the 500gb model it is large enough to store a goof number of movies songs for off line viewing as well as a few games,expensive although i love this drive in fact i just bought another one for my girlfriends laptop the 250 price tag for 500gb still makes the inner techie in me ask if the faster boot up times and quicker load times in games worth paying nearly 5 times the cost per mb small i am kind of a hoarder my computer collects a lot of games applications videos this is also compounded by the fact that i also stream record and video edit to post on youtube size becomes a huge problem and even the 1tb ssd are simply to small if you like to hold on to a lot of games applications databases video files,year,2015-01-07 08:15:53,5,2015,1,7

2206,impressed,i picked up an older kingston ssd on sale for 50 for another machine while many different topics were a factor the drive itself was slow as dirt better than the 5200rmp that it replaced but this samsung triples the speed of course there in lies the cost difference,i needed to upgrade an old intel q6600 machine that processes video encoding in the background after looking to upgrade options i felt that a nice new ssd would would do an excellent job while completely thrilled at how fast it saves video to the drive i am floored that it plugged into this old sata2 board it s crazy fast knowing that when i upgrade this drive will only get faster simply amazed me it used to encode in the background after i walked away now i may as well just stay here and wait,i am sorry i have no cons at this time i even picked it up on holiday sale so even the price was well worth the investment didn t come with a 2 5 to 3 5 converter i guess that s it i needed to use an old patriot one i had laying around,month,2015-01-04 20:29:32,5,2015,1,4
